# Glossary 

```{glossary}

agent
: an AI that is able to do multiple things (FIXME)

algorithm
: a set of instructions to complete a task; a recipe

artificial intelligence
: a sub field of computer science
: the study of intelligent agents that receive precepts from the environment and take action
: a technology that has input ouptut behavior that appears as an intelligent agent

generative pretrained transformer
: It is a transfer model that takes in tokens (FIXME

large language model
: a probability distribution that describes the structure of sequences of tokens and enables next token prediction as well as serves as a mathematical description of tokens using many parameters

learning algorithm
: an algorithm for finding patterns in data 
: a paramter optimization or parameter fitting algorithm

machine learning
: a sub field of AI; emphasizes the use of data to learn relationships, studies the algorithms that find patterns in data

model
: a simplification of some part of the world

production
: a state of a system where it is in use by users unaffiliated with the developers and generally unrestricted (except for possibly payment)
: contrast with {term}`research`, {term}`sandbox`, and {term}`development`

research
: a state of a system where is has been built and evaluated, but not deployed to general users, instead is only available to the team that built it and (potentially) other authorized users
: contrast with {term}`production`

sandbox
: a state of a system where is is available to test, but is not officially deployed, may have simulated data instead of real data or be isolated from external systems

statistical model
: a type of mathematical model that describes its object of inquiry using probability distributions

token 
: the basic units used in computational processing of texts from human spoken (not programming) languages
: a part of a word or a word, approximately like prefix, base, suffix parts, in general 1000 tokens is about 750 words
