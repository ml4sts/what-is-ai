# Glossary 

```{glossary}

agent
: an AI that is able to do multiple things (FIXME-anthropic defs)
: <fill in def that is more general>

algorithm
: a set of instructions to complete a task; a recipe

artificial intelligence
: the study of intelligent agents that receive precepts from the environment and take action
: a technology that has input ouptut behavior that appears as an intelligent agent
: a sub field of computer science

artificial neuron
: a type of function that takes a weighted sum of the inputs and passes them to an activation function
: a type of mathematical, or computer, function that approximates some functions of biological neurons

deep learning
: a type of machine learning that consists of creating large numbers of hidden layers of {term}`artifical neuron`s

discriminative model
: a type of statistical model that describes the decision boundary to make a classification

generative model
: a type of statistical model that describes the way that the underlying data is distributed with sufficient detail to be able to sample new data that is in the same distribution as the original data; often in 

generative pretrained transformer
: It is a {term}`transformer` model that takes in tokens and can be sampled from to to produce novel token sequences that are similar to its training data
: a specific type of {term}`generative model`

language
: a vocabulary and a grammar for how to combine the words in order to convey meaning

large language model
: a probability distribution that describes the structure of sequences of tokens and enables next token prediction as well as serves as a mathematical description of tokens using many parameters

learning algorithm
: an algorithm for finding patterns in data 
: a paramter optimization or parameter fitting algorithm

machine learning
: a sub field of AI; emphasizes the use of data to learn relationships, studies the algorithms that find patterns in data

model
: a simplification of some part of the world

predictive model
: a mathemtical model, typically implemented in computer code, that predicts a label for an input or an outcome based on past

production
: a state of a system where it is in use by users unaffiliated with the developers and generally unrestricted (except for possibly payment)
: contrast with {term}`research`, {term}`sandbox`, and {term}`development`

programming language
: a human readable {term}`language` that can be processed by computers and translated (either live through an interpreter or in batch through a compiler) to machine instructions that the physical computer can execute

research
: a state of a system where is has been built and evaluated, but not deployed to general users, instead is only available to the team that built it and (potentially) other authorized users
: contrast with {term}`production`

retrieval agumented generation
: a  process to produce text that is grounded in content from specific resources in order to improve the factual correctness of the text or augment with specific data that was not available to a base model at the time of traning
: commonly used to "chat with" a document or to prevent false statements 

sandbox
: a state of a system where is is available to test, but is not officially deployed, may have simulated data instead of real data or be isolated from external systems

statistical model
: a type of mathematical model that describes its object of inquiry using probability distributions

token 
: the basic units used in computational processing of texts from human spoken (not programming) languages
: a part of a word or a word, approximately like prefix, base, suffix parts, in general 1000 tokens is about 750 words
