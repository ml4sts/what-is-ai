# What *is* AI? 

Goals:
- define AI in multiple ways and contextualize the term usage
- describe *how* modern AI is built and how that differs from older algorithms
- 

## Everything and Nothing at All 



## Current Success is ML-based


## What is ML? 

All ML consists of two parts: learning and prediction 

these can also go by other names.

OpenAI published GPT3, but deployed 3.5 and forward wrapped with additional code

## Risks

### privacy

- models can leak training data @nasr2023scalable demonstrate an efficient attack on the {term}`production` chatGPT @nasr2023Extracting 

- IP risks
- Fundamentally, an LLM cannot do any actual calculations, unless it is an agent than can operate a tool (like a calculator)

### Impacts on Human Thinking

Recently, a team at Univeristy of Toronto released a pre-print demonstrating a decrease in human creativity
when asked to perform a task independently after exposure trials using an LLM @kumar2024human. 

A large-scale meta analysis found that AI+ human performance is often worse than the best of  human alone or AI alone. They also found that AI improved a person's performance mostly for *generation* tasks, but not for decision making tasks.
