:label: pythonreadability
Perhaps Python's most controversial feature is its use of indentation for statement grouping, which derives directly from ABC. It is one of the language's features that is dearest to my heart. It makes Python code more readable in two ways. First, the use of indentation reduces visual clutter and makes programs shorter, thus reducing the attention span needed to take in a basic unit of code. Second, it allows the programmer less freedom in formatting, thereby enabling a more uniform style, which makes it easier to read someone else's code.
-- Guido van Rossom, Python creator in [an essay that was the foreward to a Python book](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/foreword/)

## Neural Network 


```{math}
:label:eqnndef
y = a(w\mathbf{x} + b)
```

where: 
- $\mathbf{x}$ is the input to the artificial neuron
- $y$ is the neuron's output
- $w$ is the weights
- $b$ is the bias 
- $a$ is the {term}`activation function`
