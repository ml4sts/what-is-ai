This is resources is aimed to help explain what AI is and is not, and some starting points for risks.  

This site is built with [](xref:mystmd). This provides some nice interactive features when viewed on a computer, for example if you hover over any term like, {term}`artificial intelligence` you can see the specific definition for that term I am using in this site.  You can close hover over links to other parts of the site like the  [](#glossary) to preview that whole page in a pop up without having to lose your place. All abbreviations like AI, ML, DL are expanded when you hover as well. This should all help you read and make sense of the information faster, because definitions are defined in place @head2021Augmenting [^foots].

[^foots]: footnotes are also work this way so, while they are displayed at the bottom of the page, you do not have to scroll to read them. 


To orient:
- a good place to start is [](is), it is a high level introduction 
- [](cases) provides some more concrete examples 
- [](not) clears up common misconceptions
- [](risks) is a *very* breif primer on some important to know risks. 
- [](incidents) highlights a few examples of bad uss
