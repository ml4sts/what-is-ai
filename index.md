# Defining AI 


This is resources is aimed to help explain what AI is and is not, and some starting points for risks.  

This site is built with [myst markdown](xref:mystmd/guide#cool-myst-features). This provides some nice interactive features when viewed on a computer, for example if you hover over any term like, {term}`artificial intelligence` you can see the specific definition for that term I am using in this site. 
% You can also hover over links to other parts of the site like the [](glossary) to preview that whole page in a pop up without having to lose your place.
Abbreviations like AI, ML, DL are also expanded when you hover[^foots]. This should all help you read and make sense of the information faster, because terms are defined in place @head2021Augmenting.

[^foots]: footnotes are also work this way so, while they are displayed at the bottom of the page, you do not have to scroll to read them. 

The cross linking and glossary also aim to help make it so that you can start anywhere and as you read you will be able to pull in the context you need from other places as you read. 

To orient:
- a good place to start is [](tutorial), it is a high level introduction 
- [](cases) provides some more concrete examples 
- [](not) clears up common misconceptions
- [](risks) is a *very* breif primer on some important to know risks. 
- [](incidents) highlights a few examples of bad uss
