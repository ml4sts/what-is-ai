## Evironmental Impact

Training large language models requires an immense amount of energy and water (for cooling), using them requires less, but still a lot

## privacy

- models can leak training data. Researchers demonstrated an efficient attack on the {term}`production` chatGPT @nasr2023Extracting. Combined with the fact that free tools almost always save the data you provide them to train and improve their products, that means that anything you send to a chatbot, it could spit back out to another user.
