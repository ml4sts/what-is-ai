  abstract = {Increasing attention to the role of ethical consideration in computing has led to calls for greater integration of this critical topic into technical classes rather than siloed in standalone computing ethics classes. The motivation for such integration is not only to support in-situ learning, but also to emphasize to students that ethical consideration is inherently part of the technical practice of computing. We propose that the logical place to begin emphasizing ethics is on day one of computing education: in introductory programming classes. This paper presents one approach to ethics integration into such classes: assignments that teach basic programming concepts (e.g., conditionals or iteration) but are contextualized with real-world ethical dilemmas or concepts. We report on experiences with this approach in multiple introductory programming courses, including details about select assignments, insights from instructors and teaching assistants, and results from surveys of a subset of students who took these courses. Based on these experiences we provide preliminary plans for future work, along with a roadmap for instructors to emulate our approach and suggestions for overcoming challenges they might face.},

  abstract = {As machine learning (ML) is deployed in high-stakes domains, such as disease diagnosis or prison sentencing, questions of fairness have become an area of concern in its development. This interest has produced a variety of statistical fairness definitions derived from classical performance metrics which further expand the decisions that ML practitioners must make in building a system. The need to choose between these definitions raises questions about what conditions influence people to perceive an algorithm as fair or not. Recent results highlight the heavily contextual nature of fairness perceptions, and the specific conditions under which psychological principles such as framing can reliably sway these perceptions. Additional interdisciplinary insights include lessons from the replication crisis within psychology, from which we can glean best-practices for reproducible empirical research. We survey key research at the intersection of ML and psychology, focusing on psychological mechanisms underlying fairness preferences. We conclude by stating the continued need for interdisciplinary research, and underscore best-practices that can inform the state-of-the-art practice. We consider this research to be of a descriptive nature, enabling a deeper understanding and a substantiated discussion.},

  abstract = {A growing number of oversight boards and regulatory bodies seek to monitor and govern algorithms that make decisions about people’s lives. Prior work has explored how people believe algorithmic decisions should be made, but there is little understanding of how individual factors like sociodemographics or direct experience with a decision-making scenario may affect their ethical views. We take a step toward filling this gap by exploring how people’s perceptions of one aspect of procedural algorithmic fairness (the fairness of using particular features in an algorithmic decision) relate to their (i) demographics (age, education, gender, race, political views) and (ii) personal experiences with the algorithmic decision-making scenario. We find that political views and personal experience with the algorithmic decision context significantly influence perceptions about the fairness of using different features for bail decision-making. Drawing on our results, we discuss the implications for stakeholder engagement and algorithmic oversight including the need to consider multiple dimensions of diversity in composing oversight and regulatory bodies.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous fluctuations are a hallmark of recordings of neural signals, emergent over time scales spanning milliseconds and tens of minutes. However, investigations of intrinsic brain organization based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging have largely not taken into account the presence and potential of temporal variability, as most current approaches to examine functional connectivity (FC) implicitly assume that relationships are constant throughout the length of the recording. In this work, we describe an approach to assess whole-brain FC dynamics based on spatial independent component analysis, sliding time window correlation, and k-means clustering of windowed correlation matrices. The method is applied to resting-state data from a large sample (n = 405) of young adults. Our analysis of FC variability highlights particularly flexible connections between regions in lateral parietal and cingulate cortex, and argues against a labeling scheme where such regions are treated as separate and antagonistic entities. Additionally, clustering analysis reveals unanticipated FC states that in part diverge strongly from stationary connectivity patterns and challenge current descriptions of interactions between large-scale networks. Temporal trends in the occurrence of different FC states motivate theories regarding their functional roles and relationships with vigilance/arousal. Overall, we suggest that the study of time-varying aspects of FC can unveil flexibility in the functional coordination between different neural systems, and that the exploitation of these dynamics in further investigations may improve our understanding of behavioral shifts and adaptive processes.},

This increased representational power comes at the cost of a more challenging unsupervised learning problem of estimating the topic-word distributions when only words are observed, and the topics are hidden. This work provides a simple and efficient learning procedure that is guaranteed to recover the parameters for a wide class of topic models, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). For LDA, the procedure correctly recovers both the topic-word distributions and the parameters of the Dirichlet prior over the topic mixtures, using only trigram statistics (i.e., third order moments, which may be estimated with documents containing just three words). The method, called Excess Correlation Analysis, is based on a spectral decomposition of low-order moments via two singular value decompositions (SVDs). Moreover, the algorithm is scalable, since the SVDs are carried out only on k k matrices, where k is the number of latent factors (topics) and is typically much smaller than the dimension of the observation (word) space.},

Bayesian methods are an excellent fit for this demand, but scaling Bayesian inference is a challenge. In response to this challenge, there has been considerable recent work based on varying assumptions about model structure, underlying computational resources, and the importance of asymptotic correctness. As a result, there is a zoo of ideas with few clear overarching principles. In this paper, we seek to identify unifying principles, patterns, and intuitions for scaling Bayesian inference. We review existing work on utilizing modern computing resources with both MCMC and variational approximation techniques. From this taxonomy of ideas, we characterize the general principles that have proven successful for designing scalable inference procedures and comment on the path forward.},

Some general lower bound techniques are given. Equivalence queries are compared with Valiant's criterion of probably approximately correct identification under random sampling.},

  abstract = {Accuracy is an important concern for suppliers of artificial intelligence (AI) services, but considerations beyond accuracy, such as safety (which includes fairness and explainability), security, and provenance, are also critical elements to engender consumers' trust in a service. Many industries use transparent, standardized, but often not legally required documents called supplier's declarations of conformity (SDoCs) to describe the lineage of a product along with the safety and performance testing it has undergone. SDoCs may be considered multi-dimensional fact sheets that capture and quantify various aspects of the product and its development to make it worthy of consumers' trust. Inspired by this practice, we propose FactSheets to help increase trust in AI services. We envision such documents to contain purpose, performance, safety, security, and provenance information to be completed by AI service providers for examination by consumers. We suggest a comprehensive set of declaration items tailored to AI and provide examples for two fictitious AI services in the appendix of the paper.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, for many application areas, it is becoming important to include elements of nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity in order to model accurately the underlying dynamics of a physical system. Moreover, it is typically crucial to process data on-line as it arrives, both from the point of view of storage costs as well as for rapid adaptation to changing signal characteristics. In this paper, we review both optimal and suboptimal Bayesian algorithms for nonlinear/non-Gaussian tracking problems, with a focus on particle filters. Particle filters are sequential Monte Carlo methods based on point mass (or "particle") representations of probability densities, which can be applied to any state-space model and which generalize the traditional Kalman filtering methods. Several variants of the particle filter such as SIR, ASIR, and RPF are introduced within a generic framework of the sequential importance sampling (SIS) algorithm. These are discussed and compared with the standard EKF through an illustrative example}

  abstract = {This paper aims to frame certain fundamental aspects of the human mind (content and meaning of mental states) and foundational elements of brain computation (spatial and temporal patterns of neural activity) so as to enable at least in principle their integration within one and the same quantitative representation. Through the history of science, similar approaches have been instrumental to bridge other seemingly mysterious scientific phenomena, such as thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, optics and electromagnetism, or chemistry and quantum physics, among several other examples. Identifying the relevant levels of analysis is important to define proper mathematical formalisms for describing the brain and the mind, such that they could be mapped onto each other in order to explain their equivalence. Based on these premises, we overview the potential of neural connectivity to provide highly informative constraints on brain computational process. Moreover, we outline approaches for representing cognitive and emotional states geometrically with semantic maps. Next, we summarize leading theoretical framework that might serve as an explanatory bridge between neural connectivity and mental space. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of this framework for human communication and our view of reality. We conclude by analyzing the practical requirements to manage the necessary data for solving the mind-brain problem from this perspective.},

  abstract = {For supervised and unsupervised learning, positive definite kernels allow to use large and potentially infinite dimensional feature spaces with a computational cost that only depends on the number of observations. This is usually done through the penalization of predictor functions by Euclidean or Hilbertian norms. In this paper, we explore penalizing by sparsity-inducing norms such as the ℓ1-norm or the block ℓ1-norm. We assume that the kernel decomposes into a large sum of individual basis kernels which can be embedded in a directed acyclic graph; we show that it is then possible to perform kernel selection through a hierarchical multiple kernel learning framework, in polynomial time in the number of selected kernels. This framework is naturally applied to non linear variable selection; our extensive simulations on synthetic datasets and datasets from the UCI repository show that efficiently exploring the large feature space through sparsity-inducing norms leads to state-of-the-art predictive performance.},

  abstract = {In this article, we discuss the hypothesis that affect is a fundamental, psychologically irreducible property of the human mind. We begin by presenting historical perspectives on the nature of affect. Next, we proceed with a more contemporary discussion of core affect as a basic property of the mind that is realized within a broadly distributed neuronal workspace. We then present the affective circumplex, a mathematical formalization for representing core affective states, and show that this model can be used to represent individual differences in core affective feelings that are linked to meaningful variation in emotional experience. Finally, we conclude by suggesting that core affect has psychological consequences that reach beyond the boundaries of emotion, to influence learning and consciousness.},

  abstract = {A psychologist's task is to discover facts about the mind by measuring responses at the level of a person (e.g., reaction times, perceptions, eye or muscle movements, or bodily changes). A neuroscientist's task is to make similar discoveries by measuring responses from neurons in a brain (e.g., electrical,magnetic, blood flow or chemical measures related neurons firing).Both psychologists and neuroscientists use ideas (in the form of concepts, categories, and constructs) to transform their measurements into something meaningful. The relation between any set of numbers (reflecting a property of the person, or the activation in a set of neurons, a circuit, or a network) and a psychological construct is a psychometric issue that is formalized as a “measurement model.” The relation is also a philosophical act. Scientists (both neuroscientists and psychologists) who make such inferences, but don't explicitly declare their measurement models, are still doing philosophy, but they are doing it in stealth, enacting certain assumptions that are left unsaid. In “Mind the Gap,” Kievit and colleagues (this issue) take the admirable step of trying to unmask the measurement models that lurk within two well-defined traditions for linking the actions of neurons to the actions of people. They translate identity theory and supervenience theory into popular measurement models that exist in psychometric theory using the logic and language of structural equation modeling. By showing that both philosophical approaches can be represented as models that relate measurements to psychological constructs, Kievit et al. lay bare the fact that all measurement questions are also philosophical questions about how variation in numbers hint at or point to reality. They make the powerful point that translating philosophical assumptions into psychometric terms allows both identity theory and supervenience theory to be treated like hypotheses that can be empirically evaluated and compared in more or less a concrete way. The empirical example offered by Kievit et al. (linking intelligence to brain volume) is somewhat simplistic on both the neuroscience and psychological ends of the equation, and the nitty-gritty details of applying an explicit measurement approach to more complex data remains open, but this article represents a big step forward in negotiating the chasm between measures taken at the level of the brain and those taken at the level of the person. The overall approach is applauded, but a closer look at the details of how Kievit et al. operationalized identity and supervenience theory is in order. In science, as in philosophy, the devil is in the details. In the pages that follow, I highlight a few lurking demons that haunt the Kievit et al. approach. I don't point out every idea that I take issue with in the article, just as I don't congratulate every point of agreement. Instead, I focus in on a few key issues in formalizing identity and supervenience theory, with an eye to asking whether they are really all that different in measurement terms, as well as whether standard psychometric models can be used to operationalize each of them equally well. Like Kievit et al., I conclude that a supervenience theorymight win the day, but I try to get more specific about a version of supervenience that would successfully bridges the gap between the brain and the mind.},

  abstract = {Head motion in functional MRI and resting-state MRI is a major problem. Existing methods do not robustly reflect the true level of motion artifact for in vivo fMRI data. The primary issue is that current methods assume that motion is synchronized to the volume acquisition and thus ignore intra-volume motion. This manuscript covers three sections in the use of gold-standard motion-corrupted data to pursue an intra-volume motion correction. First, we present a way to get motion corrupted data with accurately known motion at the slice acquisition level. This technique simulates important data acquisition-related motion artifacts while acquiring real BOLD MRI data. It is based on a novel motion-injection pulse sequence that introduces known motion independently for every slice: Simulated Prospective Acquisition CorrEction (SimPACE). Secondly, with data acquired using SimPACE, we evaluate several motion correction and characterization techniques, including several commonly used BOLD signal- and motion parameter-based metrics. Finally, we introduce and evaluate a novel, slice-based motion correction technique. Our novel method, SLice-Oriented MOtion COrrection (SLOMOCO) performs better than the volumetric methods and, moreover, accurately detects the motion of independent slices, in this case equivalent to the known injected motion. We demonstrate that SLOMOCO can model and correct for nearly all effects of motion in BOLD data. Also, none of the commonly used motion metrics was observed to robustly identify motion corrupted events, especially in the most realistic scenario of sudden head movement. For some popular metrics, performance was poor even when using the ideal known slice motion instead of volumetric parameters. This has negative implications for methods relying on these metrics, such as recently proposed motion correction methods such as data censoring and global signal regression.},

  abstract = {Background: The human amygdala plays a crucial role in processing social signals, such as face expressions, particularly fearful ones, and facilitates responses to them in face-sensitive cortical regions. This contributes to social competence and individual amygdala size correlates with that of social networks. While rare patients with focal bilateral amygdala lesion typically show impaired recognition of fearful faces, this deficit is variable, and an intriguing possibility is that other brain regions can compensate to support fear and social signal processing. Methods: To investigate the brain's functional compensation of selective bilateral amygdala damage, we performed a series of behavioral, psychophysiological, and functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments in two adult female monozygotic twins (patient 1 and patient 2) with equivalent, extensive bilateral amygdala pathology as a sequela of lipoid proteinosis due to Urbach-Wiethe disease. Results: Patient 1, but not patient 2, showed preserved recognition of fearful faces, intact modulation of acoustic startle responses by fear-eliciting scenes, and a normal-sized social network. Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that patient 1 showed potentiated responses to fearful faces in her left premotor cortex face area and bilaterally in the inferior parietal lobule. Conclusions: The premotor cortex face area and inferior parietal lobule are both implicated in the cortical mirror-neuron system, which mediates learning of observed actions and may thereby promote both imitation and empathy. Taken together, our findings suggest that despite the pre-eminent role of the amygdala in processing social information, the cortical mirror-neuron system may sometimes adaptively compensate for its pathology. © 2012 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

  abstract = {The “impossibility theorem” — which is considered foundational in algorithmic fairness literature — asserts that there must be trade-offs between common notions of fairness and performance when fitting statistical models, except in two special cases: when the prevalence of the outcome being predicted is equal across groups, or when a perfectly accurate predictor is used. However, theory does not always translate to practice. In this work, we challenge the implications of the impossibility theorem in practical settings. First, we show analytically that, by slightly relaxing the impossibility theorem (to accommodate a practitioner’s perspective of fairness), it becomes possible to identify abundant sets of models that satisfy seemingly incompatible fairness constraints. Second, we demonstrate the existence of these models through extensive experiments on five real-world datasets. We conclude by offering tools and guidance for practitioners to understand when — and to what degree — fairness along multiple criteria can be achieved. This work has an important implication for the community: achieving fairness along multiple metrics for multiple groups (and their intersections) is much more possible than was previously believed.},

In spite of the popularity of stability in practical applications, there has been very little theoreti- cal analysis of this notion. In this paper we provide a formal definition of stability and analyze some of its basic properties. Quite surprisingly, the conclusion of our analysis is that for large sample size, stability is fully determined by the behavior of the ob jective function which the clustering algorithm is aiming to minimize. If the ob jective function has a unique global minimizer, the algorithm is stable, otherwise it is un- stable. In particular we conclude that stability is not a well-suited tool to determine the number of clusters - it is determined by the symme- tries of the data which may be unrelated to clustering parameters. We prove our results for center-based clusterings and for spectral clustering, and support our conclusions by many examples in which the behavior of stability is counter-intuitive.},

  abstract = {Many applications require the analysis of complex interactions between time series. These interactions can be non-linear and involve vector valued as well as complex data structures such as graphs or strings. Here we provide a general framework for the statistical analysis of these dependencies when random variables are sampled from stationary time-series of arbitrary objects. To achieve this goal, we study the properties of the Kernel Cross-Spectral Density (KCSD) operator induced by positive definite kernels on arbitrary input domains. This framework enables us to develop an independence test between time series, as well as a similarity measure to compare different types of coupling. The performance of our test is compared to the HSIC test using i.i.d. assumptions, showing improvements in terms of detection errors, as well as the suitability of this approach for testing dependency in complex dynamical systems. This similarity measure enables us to identify different types of interactions in electrophysiological neural time series.},

The application of machine learning techniques in other areas such as pattern recognition has resulted in accumulated experience as to correct and principled approaches for their use. The aim of this paper is to give an account of issues affecting the application of machine learning tools, focusing primarily on general aspects of feature and model parameter selection, rather than any single specific algorithm. These aspects are discussed in the context of published bioinformatics studies in leading journals over the last 5 years. We assess to what degree the experience gained by the pattern recognition research community pervades these bioinformatics studies. We finally discuss various critical issues relating to bioinformatic data sets and make a number of recommendations on the proper use of machine learning techniques for bioinformatics research based upon previously published research on machine learning.},

Moreover, in a third independent sample, we discovered that people who fostered and maintained larger and more complex social networks not only had larger amygdala volumes, but also amygdalae with stronger intrinsic connectivity within two of these networks: one putatively subserving perceptual abilities and one subserving affiliative behaviors. Our findings were anatomically specific to amygdalar circuitry in that individual differences in social network size and complexity could not be explained by the strength of intrinsic connectivity between nodes within two networks that do not typically involve the amygdala (i.e., the mentalizing and mirror networks), and were behaviorally specific in that amygdala connectivity did not correlate with other self-report measures of sociality.},

  abstract = {Several decades of research in the field of machine learning have resulted in a multitude of different algorithms for solving a broad range of problems. To tackle a new application, a researcher typically tries to map their problem onto one of these existing methods, often influenced by their familiarity with specific algorithms and by the availability of corresponding software implementations. In this study, we describe an alternative methodology for applying machine learning, in which a bespoke solution is formulated for each new application. The solution is expressed through a compact modelling language, and the corresponding custom machine learning code is then generated automatically. This model-based approach offers several major advantages, including the opportunity to create highly tailored models for specific scenarios, as well as rapid prototyping and comparison of a range of alternative models. Furthermore, newcomers to the field of machine learning do not have to learn about the huge range of traditional methods, but instead can focus their attention on understanding a single modelling environment. In this study, we show how probabilistic graphical models, coupled with efficient inference algorithms, provide a very flexible foundation for model-based machine learning, and we outline a large-scale commercial application of this framework involving tens of millions of users. We also describe the concept of probabilistic programming as a powerful software environment for model-based machine learning, and we discuss a specific probabilistic programming language called Infer.NET, which has been widely used in practical applications.},

In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

In the analysis of a data set on the frequency of different emotion experiences we find that a Poisson model with a single random effect does not yield an adequate fit. An alternative model that requires as many random effects as emotion categories requires high-dimensional integration and the estimation of a large number of parameters. As a solution to these computational problems, we propose a factor-analytic Poisson model and show that a two-dimensional factor model fits the reported data very well. Moreover, it yields a substantively satisfactory solution: one factor describing the degree of pleasantness and unpleasantness of emotions and the other factor describing the activation levels of the emotions. We discuss the incorporation of covariates to facilitate rigorous tests of the random-effects structure. Marginal maximum likelihood methods lead to straight-forward estimation of the model, for which goodness-of-fit tests are also presented.},

  abstract = {Author SummaryTwo observations about the cortex have puzzled and fascinated neuroscientists for a long time. First, neural responses are highly variable. Second, the level of excitation and inhibition received by each neuron is tightly balanced at all times. Here, we demonstrate that both properties are necessary consequences of neural networks representing information reliably and with a small number of spikes. To achieve such efficiency, spikes of individual neurons must communicate prediction errors about a common population-level signal, automatically resulting in balanced excitation and inhibition and highly variable neural responses. We illustrate our approach by focusing on the implementation of linear dynamical systems. Among other things, this allows us to construct a network of spiking neurons that can integrate input signals, yet is robust against many perturbations. Most importantly, our approach shows that neural variability cannot be equated to noise. Despite exhibiting the same single unit properties as other widely used network models, our balanced networks are orders of magnitudes more reliable. Our results suggest that the precision of cortical representations has been strongly underestimated.}

  abstract = {In computational science literature including, e.g., bioinformatics, computational statistics or machine learning, most published articles are devoted to the development of "new methods", while comparison studies are generally appreciated by readers but surprisingly given poor consideration by many journals. This paper stresses the importance of neutral comparison studies for the objective evaluation of existing methods and the establishment of standards by drawing parallels with clinical research. The goal of the paper is twofold. Firstly, we present a survey of recent computational papers on supervised classification published in seven high-ranking computational science journals. The aim is to provide an up-to-date picture of current scientific practice with respect to the comparison of methods in both articles presenting new methods and articles focusing on the comparison study itself. Secondly, based on the results of our survey we critically discuss the necessity, impact and limitations of neutral comparison studies in computational sciences. We define three reasonable criteria a comparison study has to fulfill in order to be considered as neutral, and explicate general considerations on the individual components of a "tidy neutral comparison study". R codes for completely replicating our statistical analyses and figures are available from the companion website http://www.ibe.med.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/mitarbeiter/020\_professuren/boulesteix/plea2013.},

  abstract = {How do neural networks learn to represent information optimally? We answer this question by deriving spiking dynamics and learning dynamics directly from a measure of network performance. We find that a network of integrate-and-fire neurons undergoing Hebbian plasticity can learn an optimal spike-based repre- sentation for a linear decoder. The learning rule acts to minimise the membrane potential magnitude, which can be interpreted as a representation error after learn- ing. In this way, learning reduces the representation error and drives the network into a robust, balanced regime. The network becomes balanced because small rep- resentation errors correspond to small membrane potentials, which in turn results from a balance of excitation and inhibition. The representation is robust because neurons become self-correcting, only spiking if the representation error exceeds a threshold. Altogether, these results suggest that many observed features of cor- tical dynamics, such as excitatory-inhibitory balance, integrate-and-fire dynamics and Hebbian plasticity, are signatures of a robust, optimal spike-based code.},

  abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57\%, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathemati-cians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of ana-lyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, govern-ment records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data ana-lytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communi-cation and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what 'research' means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data: a cultural, techno-logical, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric. Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral . . . technology's inter-action with the social ecology is such that technical developments frequently have environmental, social, and human consequences that go far beyond the immediate purposes of the technical devices and practices themselves.},

  abstract = {Intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), such as the default mode, frontoparietal control, and salience networks, provide a useful large-scale description of the functional architecture of the brain. Although ICNs are functionally specialized, the information that they process needs to be integrated for coherent cognition, perception, and behavior. A region capable of performing this integration might be expected to contain traces, or "echoes," of the neural signals from multiple ICNs. Here, using fMRI in humans, we show the existence of specific "transmodal" regions containing echoes of multiple ICNs. These regions include core nodes of the default mode network, as well as multimodal association regions of the temporoparietal and temporo-occipito-parietal junction, right middle frontal gyrus, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast, "unimodal" regions such as the primary sensory and motor cortices show a much more singular pattern of activity, containing traces of few or even single ICNs. The presence of ICN echoes might explain how transmodal regions are involved in multiple different cognitive states. Our results suggest that these transmodal regions have a particular local spatial organization containing topographic maps that relate to multiple ICNs. This makes transmodal regions uniquely placed to be able to mediate the cross talk between the brain's functional networks through local modulation of adjacent regions that communicate with different ICNs.},

Although it has long been assumed that cognitive functions are attributable to the isolated operations of single brain areas, we demonstrate that the weight of evidence has now shifted in support of the view that cognition results from the dynamic interactions of distributed brain areas operating in large-scale networks. We review current research on structural and functional brain organization, and argue that the emerging science of large-scale brain networks provides a coherent framework for understanding of cognition. Critically, this framework allows a principled exploration of how cognitive functions emerge from, and are constrained by, core structural and functional networks of the brain. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Partnerships are presented as being a subset of relationships between persons. The quality of these dyadic relationships is analyzed in terms of the degree to which the interactions possess closeness, equity, and integrity, and the degree to which the outcomes of those interactions are exploitive, transactional, or transformational. Implications are then offered for how this analysis can improve practice and research.}

Kulis \& Jordan (2012) used this observation to obtain a novel K-means-like algorithm from a Gibbs sampler for the Dirichlet process (DP) mixture. We instead consider applying small-variance asymptotics directly to the posterior in Bayesian nonparametric models. This framework is independent of any specific Bayesian inference algorithm, and it has the major advantage that it generalizes immediately to a range of models beyond the DP mixture. To illustrate, we apply our framework to the feature learning setting, where the beta process and Indian buffet process provide an appropriate Bayesian nonparametric prior. We obtain a novel objective function that goes beyond clustering to learn (and penalize new) groupings for which we relax the mutual exclusivity and exhaustivity assumptions of clustering. We demonstrate several other algorithms, all of which are scalable and simple to implement. Empirical results demonstrate the benefits of the new framework.},

The program originated in 2002, and over the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 leadership years the program was revised and refined to have clear objectives and subcomponents consisting of both informal and formal educational components. The program is organized at a national level and administered locally in a grassroots fashion. Sample program models and resources are provided to local student leadership for selective implementation with the support of national and regional student leaders. In this paper we examine the program model and the ability to measure impact through the grassroots student run organization of the program. We present preliminary data from pilot programs and evaluations from volunteers and local level leaders of both the program model and the impact of the program. Data collected from participants includes demographics data, efficacy and learning assessments, and evaluations of the programs? content. This data is collected through survey templates provided to local student leaders, tabulated locally, and returned to the National leadership. Through the pilot studies the data collection and research methods are verified for their effectiveness in this unique program model. This paper will present the program assessment for internal development as well as address research questions about engineering students involved in STEM mentoring activities. Finally we present recommendations for developing the program further and a plan for a comprehensive study of the impact of the program. In short term for the students benefitting and longer term of the mentors and volunteers involved. A research plan and toolkit that accommodates for this and allows for sample size increases toward significance are derived from the pilot results. © 2011 American Society for Engineering Education.}

  abstract = {The National Society of Black Engineers' Technical OutReach Community Help (TORCH) program aims to promote the value of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education at all levels by increasing exposure, enthusiasm, skills, and participation within the Black community. This initiative is accomplished through unique formal and informal experiences led by Black college student-leaders within the student-run national organization at local, regional and national scales. The program components include formal classroom-style training, informal activities, grassroots outreach, direct technical service and, for organizational reasons, traditional community service activities as well. The program was developed and is managed centrally, but the majority of program implementation is facilitated by host organization's chapters, operating independently. The success of the program is driven by the student chapters and the community partnerships they create in the implementation of its activities. Through their creativity and leadership the partnerships created have ranged from technology to education. Furthermore, frequent leadership changes annually at all levels pose an additional threat to sustaining these essential relationships. We present preliminary analysis of the formation and maintenance of community partnerships for each of the program components and their impact on the efforts. We take as examples several programs that have been active over varying lengths of time and examine the interactions between the types of partnerships, attendance at various program components and student volunteer participation. © American Society of Engeneering Education, 2013.}

The brain's structural and functional systems have features of complex networks–such as small-world topology, highly connected hubs and modularity–both at the whole-brain scale of human neuroimaging and at a cellular scale in non-human animals. In this article, we review studies investigating complex brain networks in diverse experimental modalities (including structural and functional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography in humans) and provide an accessible introduction to the basic principles of graph theory. We also highlight some of the technical challenges and key questions to be addressed by future developments in this rapidly moving field.},

These mechanisms of classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms, and in many cases on machine learning algorithms to do this work. In this article, I draw a distinction between three forms of opacity: (1) opacity as intentional corporate or state secrecy (2) opacity as technical illiteracy, and (3) an opacity that arises from the characteristics of machine learning algorithms and the scale required to apply them usefully. The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves. I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight code audit. I argue that recognizing the distinct forms of opacity that may be coming into play in a given application is key to determining which of a variety of technical and non-technical solutions could help to prevent harm.},

  abstract = {Neuroscience is undergoing faster changes than ever before. Over 100 years our field qualitatively described and invasively manipulated single or few organisms to gain anatomical, physiological, and pharmacological insights. In the last 10 years neuroscience spawned quantitative datasets of unprecedented breadth (e.g., microanatomy, synaptic connections, and optogenetic brain-behavior assays) and size (e.g., cognition, brain imaging, and genetics). While growing data availability and information granularity have been amply discussed, we direct attention to a less explored question: How will the unprecedented data richness shape data analysis practices? Statistical reasoning is becoming more important to distill neurobiological knowledge from healthy and pathological brain measurements. We argue that large-scale data analysis will use more statistical models that are non-parametric, generative, and mixing frequentist and Bayesian aspects, while supplementing classical hypothesis testing with out-of-sample predictions.},

  abstract = {Advocates of Big Data assert that we are in the midst of an epistemological revolution, promising the displacement of the modernist methodological hegemony of causal analysis and theory generation. It is alleged that the growing ‘deluge' of digitally generated data, and the development of computational algorithms to analyse them, has enabled new inductive ways of accessing everyday relational interactions through their ‘datafication'. This article critically engages with these discourses of Big Data and complexity, particularly as they operate in the discipline of International Relations, where it is alleged that Big Data approaches have the potential for developing self-governing societal capacities for resilience and adaptation through the real-time reflexive awareness and management of risks and problems as they arise. The epistemological and ontological assumptions underpinning Big Data are then analysed to suggest that critical and posthumanist approaches have come of age through these discourses, enabling process-based and relational understandings to be translated into policy and governance practices. The article thus raises some questions for the development of critical approaches to new posthuman forms of governance and knowledge production.}

  abstract = {Probabilistic topic models are a popular tool for the unsupervised analysis of text, providing both a predictive model of future text and a latent topic representation of the corpus. Practitioners typically assume that the latent space is semantically meaningful. It is used to check models, summarize the corpus, and guide exploration of its contents. However, whether the latent space is interpretable is in need of quantitative evaluation. In this paper, we present new quantitative methods for measuring semantic meaning in inferred topics. We back these measures with large-scale user studies, showing that they capture aspects of the model that are undetected by previous measures of model quality based on held-out likelihood. Surprisingly, topic models which perform better on held-out likelihood may infer less semantically meaningful topics.},

  abstract = {A common theme in social science studies of algorithms is that they are profoundly opaque and function as “black boxes.” Scholars have developed several methodological approaches in order to address algorithmic opacity. Here I argue that we can explicitly enroll algorithms in ethnographic research, which can shed light on unexpected aspects of algorithmic systems—including their opacity. I delineate three mesolevel strategies for algorithmic ethnography. The first, algorithmic refraction, examines the reconfigurations that take place when computational software, people, and institutions interact. The second strategy, algorithmic comparison, relies on a similarity-anddifference approach to identify the instruments’ unique features. The third strategy, algorithmic triangulation, enrolls algorithms to help gather rich qualitative data. I conclude by discussing the implications of this toolkit for the study of algorithms and future of ethnographic fieldwork.},

  abstract = {Studies employing functional connectivity-type analyses have established that spontaneous fluctuations in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals are organized within large-scale brain networks. Meanwhile, fMRI signals have been shown to exhibit 1/f-type power spectra - a hallmark of scale-free dynamics. We studied the interplay between functional connectivity and scale-free dynamics in fMRI signals, utilizing the fractal connectivity framework - a multivariate extension of the univariate fractional Gaussian noise model, which relies on a wavelet formulation for robust parameter estimation. We applied this framework to fMRI data acquired from healthy young adults at rest and while performing a visual detection task. First, we found that scale-invariance existed beyond univariate dynamics, being present also in bivariate cross-temporal dynamics. Second, we observed that frequencies within the scale-free range do not contribute evenly to inter-regional connectivity, with a systematically stronger contribution of the lowest frequencies, both at rest and during task. Third, in addition to a decrease of the Hurst exponent and inter-regional correlations, task performance modified cross-temporal dynamics, inducing a larger contribution of the highest frequencies within the scale-free range to global correlation. Lastly, we found that across individuals, a weaker task modulation of the frequency contribution to inter-regional connectivity was associated with better task performance manifesting as shorter and less variable reaction times. These findings bring together two related fields that have hitherto been studied separately - resting-state networks and scale-free dynamics, and show that scale-free dynamics of human brain activity manifest in cross-regional interactions as well. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

There are 2 ways in which Saarimaki et al.'s interpretation mischaracterizes their actual findings. The first is statistical: a pattern that successfully distinguishes the members of one category from the members of another (with an accuracy greater than that which might be expected by chance) is not a "fingerprint" (i.e., an essence); it is an abstract, statistical summary of a variable population of instances. The second way in which Saarimaki et al.'s interpretation mischaracterizes their results is conceptual: their findings do not actually meet the specific criteria for basic emotion theory. Instead, their findings are more consistent with a theory of constructed emotion. In our view, Saarimaki et al. is elegant in method and important in that it demonstrates empirical support for a theory of emotion that relies on population thinking; it is also an example of how essentialism-the belief that all instances of a category possesses necessary features that define what is, and what is not, a category member-contributes to a fundamental misunderstanding of the neural basis of emotion.},

  abstract = {Algorithms are now regularly used to decide whether defendants awaiting trial are too dangerous to be released back into the community. In some cases, black defendants are substantially more likely than white defendants to be incorrectly classified as high risk. To mitigate such disparities, several techniques recently have been proposed to achieve algorithmic fairness. Here we reformulate algorithmic fairness as constrained optimization: the objective is to maximize public safety while satisfying formal fairness constraints designed to reduce racial disparities. We show that for several past definitions of fairness, the optimal algorithms that result require detaining defendants above race-specific risk thresholds. We further show that the optimal unconstrained algorithm requires applying a single, uniform threshold to all defendants. The unconstrained algorithm thus maximizes public safety while also satisfying one important understanding of equality: that all individuals are held to the same standard, irrespective of race. Because the optimal constrained and unconstrained algorithms generally differ, there is tension between improving public safety and satisfying prevailing notions of algorithmic fairness. By examining data from Broward County, Florida, we show that this trade-off can be large in practice. We focus on algorithms for pretrial release decisions, but the principles we discuss apply to other domains, and also to human decision makers carrying out structured decision rules.},

  abstract = {The fluctuations in a brain region's activation levels over a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time-course are used in functional connectivity (FC) to identify networks with synchronous responses. It is increasingly recognized that multi-voxel activity patterns contain information that cannot be extracted from univariate activation levels. Here we present a novel analysis method that quantifies regions' synchrony in multi-voxel activity pattern discriminability, rather than univariate activation, across a timeseries. We introduce a measure of multi-voxel pattern discriminability at each time-point, which is then used to identify regions that share synchronous time-courses of condition-specific multi-voxel information. This method has the sensitivity and access to distributed information that multi-voxel pattern analysis enjoys, allowing it to be applied to data from conditions not separable by univariate responses. We demonstrate this by analyzing data collected while people viewed four different types of man-made objects (typically not separable by univariate analyses) using both FC and informational connectivity (IC) methods. IC reveals networks of object-processing regions that are not detectable using FC. The IC results support prior findings and hypotheses about object processing. This new method allows investigators to ask questions that are not addressable through typical FC, just as multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has added new research avenues to those addressable with the general linear model (GLM).},

  abstract = {Little is known about how attention changes the cortical representation of sensory information in humans. On the basis of neurophysiological evidence, we hypothesized that attention causes tuning changes to expand the representation of attended stimuli at the cost of unattended stimuli. To investigate this issue, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure how semantic representation changed during visual search for different object categories in natural movies. We found that many voxels across occipito-temporal and fronto-parietal cortex shifted their tuning toward the attended category. These tuning shifts expanded the representation of the attended category and of semantically related, but unattended, categories, and compressed the representation of categories that were semantically dissimilar to the target. Attentional warping of semantic representation occurred even when the attended category was not present in the movie; thus, the effect was not a target-detection artifact. These results suggest that attention dynamically alters visual representation to optimize processing of behaviorally relevant objects during natural vision.},

We use the framework to design the architecture of a customizable tool that can be used to analyse the key execution properties of scientific workflows at authoring stage. Our design is generic and can be applied to a wide variety of scientific workflow languages and systems, and is evaluated by building a prototype of the tool for the Discovery Net system.

Whilst relevant empirical data should, where possible, provide the basis for such priors, it is often the case that limitations in data and/or our understanding may preclude direct construction of a data-based prior. Formal expert elicitation methods are a key technique that can be used to determine priors in these situations. Within GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), we have adopted a structured approach to prior elicitation based on the SHELF elicitation framework, and routinely use this in conjunction with calculation of probability of success (assurance) of the next study(s) to inform internal decision making at key project milestones. The aim of this paper is to share our experiences of embedding the use of prior elicitation within a large pharmaceutical company, highlighting both the benefits and challenges of prior elicitation through a series of case studies. We have found that putting team beliefs into the shape of a quantitative probability distribution provides a firm anchor for all internal decision making, enabling teams to provide investment boards with formally appropriate estimates of the probability of trial success as well as robust plans for interim decision rules where appropriate. As an added benefit, the elicitation process provides transparency about the beliefs and risks of the potential medicine, ultimately enabling better portfolio and company-wide decision making.},

  abstract = {Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder characterized by functional dysconnectivity or abnormal integration between distant brain regions. Recent functional imaging studies have implicated large-scale thalamo-cortical connectivity as being disrupted in patients. However, observed connectivity differences in schizophrenia have been inconsistent between studies, with reports of hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity between the same brain regions. Using resting state eyes-closed functional imaging and independent component analysis on a multi-site data that included 151 schizophrenia patients and 163 age- and gender matched healthy controls, we decomposed the functional brain data into 100 components and identified 47 as functionally relevant intrinsic connectivity networks. We subsequently evaluated group differences in functional network connectivity, both in a static sense, computed as the pairwise Pearson correlations between the full network time courses (5.4 minutes in length), and a dynamic sense, computed using sliding windows (44 s in length) and k-means clustering to characterize five discrete functional connectivity states. Static connectivity analysis revealed that compared to healthy controls, patients show significantly stronger connectivity, i.e., hyperconnectivity, between the thalamus and sensory networks (auditory, motor and visual), as well as reduced connectivity (hypoconnectivity) between sensory networks from all modalities. Dynamic analysis suggests that (1), on average, schizophrenia patients spend much less time than healthy controls in states typified by strong, large-scale connectivity, and (2), that abnormal connectivity patterns are more pronounced during these connectivity states. In particular, states exhibiting cortical–subcortical antagonism (anti-correlations) and strong positive connectivity between sensory networks are those that show the group differences of thalamic hyperconnectivity and sensory hypoconnectivity. Group differences are weak or absent during other connectivity states. Dynamic analysis also revealed hypoconnectivity between the putamen and sensory networks during the same states of thalamic hyperconnectivity; notably, this finding cannot be observed in the static connectivity analysis. Finally, in post-hoc analyses we observed that the relationships between sub-cortical low frequency power and connectivity with sensory networks is altered in patients, suggesting different functional interactions between sub-cortical nuclei and sensorimotor cortex during specific connectivity states. While important differences between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls have been identified, one should interpret the results with caution given the history of medication in patients. Taken together, our results support and expand current knowledge regarding dysconnectivity in schizophrenia, and strongly advocate the use of dynamic analyses to better account for and understand functional connectivity differences.},

The data is modeled as the output of a multivariate GP. The inputs to that Gaussian process are then governed by another GP. A single layer model is equivalent to a standard GP or the GP latent vari- able model (GP-LVM).We perform inference in the model by approximate variational marginal- ization. This results in a strict lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the model which we use for model selection (number of layers and nodes per layer). Deep belief networks are typically ap- plied to relatively large data sets using stochas- tic gradient descent for optimization. Our fully Bayesian treatment allows for the application of deep models even when data is scarce. Model se- lection by our variational bound shows that a five layer hierarchy is justified even when modelling a digit data set containing only 150 examples.},

  abstract = {Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) was introduced to study the effective connectivity among brain regions using neuroimaging data. Until recently, DCM relied on deterministic models of distributed neuronal responses to external perturbation (e.g., sensory stimulation or task demands). However, accounting for stochastic fluctuations in neuronal activity and their interaction with task-specific processes may be of particular importance for studying state-dependent interactions. Furthermore, allowing for random neuronal fluctuations may render DCM more robust to model misspecification and finesse problems with network identification. In this article, we examine stochastic dynamic causal models (sDCM) in relation to their deterministic counterparts (dDCM) and highlight questions that can only be addressed with sDCM. We also compare the network identification performance of deterministic and stochastic DCM, using Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical case study of absence epilepsy. For example, our results demonstrate that stochastic DCM can exploit the modelling of neural noise to discriminate between direct and mediated connections. We conclude with a discussion of the added value and limitations of sDCM, in relation to its deterministic homologue.},

These networks of spontaneous activity correlation or resting state networks (RSN) are closely related to the underlying anatomical connectivity, but their topography is also gated by the history of prior task activation. Network coherence does not depend on covert cognitive activity, but its strength and integrity relates to behavioral performance. Some RSN are functionally organized as dynamically competing systems both at rest and during tasks. Computational studies show that one of such dynamics, the anticorrelation between networks, depends on noise-driven transitions between different multistable cluster synchronization states. These multistable states emerge because of transmission delays between regions that are modeled as coupled oscillators systems.

  abstract = {A broad body of experimental work has demonstrated that apparently spontaneous brain activity is not random. At the level of large-scale neural systems, as measured with functional MRI (fMRI), this ongoing activity reflects the organization of a series of highly coherent functional networks. These so-called resting-state networks (RSNs) closely relate to the underlying anatomical connectivity but cannot be understood in those terms alone. Here we review three large-scale neural system models of primate neocortex that emphasize the key contributions of local dynamics, signal transmission delays and noise to the emerging RSNs. We propose that the formation and dissolution of resting-state patterns reflects the exploration of possible functional network configurations around a stable anatomical skeleton.},

  abstract = {Predicting how a proposed cancer treatment will affect a given tumor can be cast as a machine learning problem, but the complexity of biological systems, the number of potentially relevant genomic and clinical features, and the lack of very large scale patient data repositories make this a unique challenge. "Pure data" approaches to this problem are underpowered to detect combinatorially complex interactions and are bound to uncover false correlations despite statistical precautions taken (1). To investigate this setting, we propose a method to integrate simulations, a strong form of prior knowledge, into machine learning, a combination which to date has been largely unexplored. The results of multiple simulations (under various uncertainty scenarios) are used to compute similarity measures between every pair of samples: sample pairs are given a high similarity score if they behave similarly under a wide range of simulation parameters. These similarity values, rather than the original high dimensional feature data, are used to train kernelized machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, thus handling the curse-of-dimensionality that typically affects genomic machine learning. Using four synthetic datasets of complex systems–three biological models and one network flow optimization model–we demonstrate that when the number of training samples is small compared to the number of features, the simulation kernel approach dominates over no-prior-knowledge methods. In addition to biology and medicine, this approach should be applicable to other disciplines, such as weather forecasting, financial markets, and agricultural management, where predictive models are sought and informative yet approximate simulations are available. The Python SimKern software, the models (in MATLAB, Octave, and R), and the datasets are made freely available at https://github.com/davidcraft/SimKern .},

Inhibitory currents not only match excitatory currents on average, but track them on a millisecond time scale, whether they are caused by external stimuli or spontaneous fluctuations. We review, together with experimental evidence, recent theoretical approaches that investigate the advantages of such tight balance for coding and computation. These studies suggest a possible revision of the dominant view that neurons represent information with firing rates corrupted by Poisson noise. Instead, tight excitatory/inhibitory balance may be a signature of a highly cooperative code, orders of magnitude more precise than a Poisson rate code. Moreover, tight balance may provide a template that allows cortical neurons to construct high-dimensional population codes and learn complex functions of their inputs.},

Epochs of transiently high within-network band limited power (BLP) correlation were identified and correlation of BLP time-series across networks was assessed in these epochs. These analyses demonstrate that functional networks are not equivalent with respect to cross-network interactions. The default-mode network and the posterior cingulate cortex, in particular, exhibit the highest degree of transient BLP correlation with other networks especially in the 14-25 Hz (β band) frequency range. Our results indicate that the previously demonstrated neuroanatomical centrality of the PCC and DMN has a physiological counterpart in the temporal dynamics of network interaction at behaviorally relevant timescales. This interaction involved subsets of nodes from other networks during periods in which their internal correlation was low.},

Dysfunction in these mechanisms may serve as risk markers for psychopathology, while emotion regulation research demonstrates that some of them are susceptible to volitional control.

  abstract = {As machine learning systems become ubiquitous, there has been a surge of interest in interpretable machine learning: systems that provide explanation for their outputs. These explanations are often used to qualitatively assess other criteria such as safety or non-discrimination. However, despite the interest in interpretability, there is very little consensus on what interpretable machine learning is and how it should be measured. In this position paper, we first define interpretability and describe when interpretability is needed (and when it is not). Next, we suggest a taxonomy for rigorous evaluation and expose open questions towards a more rigorous science of interpretable machine learning.},

  abstract = {The Indian Buffet Process (IBP) is a nonparametric prior for latent feature models in which observations are influenced by a combination of hidden features. For example, images may be composed of several objects and sounds may consist of several notes. Latent feature models seek to infer these unobserved features from a set of observations; the IBP provides a principled prior in situations where the number of hidden features is unknown. Current inference methods for the IBP have all relied on sampling. While these methods are guaranteed to be accurate in the limit, samplers for the IBP tend to mix slowly in practice. We develop a deterministic variational method for inference in the IBP based on a truncated stick-breaking approximation, provide theoretical bounds on the truncation error, and evaluate our method in several data regimes.},

We show, however, that the widely used commercial risk assessment software COMPAS is no more accurate or fair than predictions made by people with little or no criminal justice expertise. In addition, despite COMPAS's collection of 137 features, the same accuracy can be achieved with a simple linear classifier with only two features.},

  abstract = {Overfitting is the bane of data analysts, even when data are plentiful. Formal approaches to understanding this problem focus on statistical inference and generalization of individual analysis procedures. Yet the practice of data analysis is an inherently interactive and adaptive process: new analyses and hypotheses are proposed after seeing the results of previous ones, parameters are tuned on the basis of obtained results, and datasets are shared and reused. An investigation of this gap has recently been initiated by the authors in (Dwork et al., 2014), where we focused on the problem of estimating expectations of adaptively chosen functions. In this paper, we give a simple and practical method for reusing a holdout (or testing) set to validate the accuracy of hypotheses produced by a learning algorithm operating on a training set. Reusing a holdout set adaptively multiple times can easily lead to overfitting to the holdout set itself. We give an algorithm that enables the validation of a large number of adaptively chosen hypotheses, while provably avoiding overfitting. We illustrate the advantages of our algorithm over the standard use of the holdout set via a simple synthetic experiment. We also formalize and address the general problem of data reuse in adaptive data analysis. We show how the differential-privacy based approach given in (Dwork et al., 2014) is applicable much more broadly to adaptive data analysis. We then show that a simple approach based on description length can also be used to give guarantees of statistical validity in adaptive settings. Finally, we demonstrate that these incomparable approaches can be unified via the notion of approximate max-information that we introduce.},

We present proofs on the dimensionality biases of these feature criteria, and present a cross-projection normalization scheme that can be applied to any criterion to ameliorate these biases. Our experiments show the need for feature selection, the need for addressing these two issues, and the effectiveness of our proposed solutions.},

Yet, it is unclear whether these strategies represent distinct cognitive styles associated with psychopathology, such that there are individuals who are predominantly "suppressors" or "reappraisers." Using cluster analysis, we examined whether women with and without exposure to potentially traumatic events evidence distinct patterns of emotion regulation frequency, capacity, suppression, and cognitive reappraisal. Four patterns emerged: high regulators; high reappraisers/low suppressors; moderate reappraisers/low suppressors; and low regulators. Individuals who reported infrequently and ineffectively regulating their emotions (low regulators) also reported higher depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In contrast, individuals who reported frequently and effectively using reappraisal and low levels of suppression (high reappraisers/low suppressors) reported the lowest levels of these symptoms, suggesting that this specific combination of emotion regulation may be most adaptive. Our findings highlight that the capacity to regulate emotions and the ability to flexibly apply different strategies based on the context and timing may be associated with reduced psychopathology and more adaptive functioning.},

The latter task has attracted comparatively little attention. In this article, we introduce two elicitation methods that aim to complete the prior structure of the normal and gamma GLMs. First, we develop a method of assessing a conjugate prior distribution for the error variance in normal linear models. The method quantifies an expert's opinions through assessments of a median and conditional medians. Second, we propose a novel method for eliciting a lognormal prior distribution for the scale parameter of gamma GLMs. Given the mean value of a gamma distributed response variable, the method is based on conditional quartile assessments. It can also be used to quantify an expert's opinion about the prior distribution for the shape parameter of any gamma random variable, if the mean of the distribution has been elicited or is assumed to be known. In the context of GLMs, the mean value is determined by the regression coefficients. Interactive graphics is the medium through which assessments for the two proposed methods are elicited. Examples illustrating use of the methods are given. Computer programs that implement both methods are available.},

Across diverse definitions of intersectionality, we find three common assumptions: (1) There is a recognition that all people are characterized simultaneously by multiple social categories and that these categories are interconnected or intertwined. (2) Embedded within each of these categories is a dimension of inequality or power. (3) These categories are properties of the individual as well as characteristics of the social context inhabited by those individuals; as such, categories and their significance may be fluid and dynamic. Understanding intersectionality as an approach and critical theory, rather than as a falsifiable theory, we consider its potential within research using quantitative methods. We discuss positivism, social constructionism, and standpoint epistemology in order to examine the implications of these epistemologies for research methods and to explore how compatible an intersectional approach may be with each. With an eye toward expanding the incorporation of intersectional approaches in the psychology of women, we discuss both the challenges and the potential of combining quantitative methods and intersectionality. We contend that quantitative methods can be used within an intersectional approach and that doing so will expand and develop the study of intersectionality, insofar as more research tools will be available to intersectionality researchers. We also contend that quantitative researchers should incorporate an intersectional approach into their work and that doing so will enrich and deepen our understanding of psychological constructs and processes.},

  abstract = {Given recent experimental results suggesting that neural circuits may evolve through multiple firing states, we develop a framework for estimating state-dependent neural response properties from spike train data. We modify the traditional hidden Markov model (HMM) framework to incorporate stimulus-driven, non-Poisson point-process observations. For maximal flexibility, we allow external, time-varying stimuli and the neurons' own spike histories to drive both the spiking behavior in each state and the transitioning behavior between states. We employ an appropriately modified expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the model parameters. The expectation step is solved by the standard forward-backward algorithm for HMMs. The maximization step reduces to a set of separable concave optimization problems if the model is restricted slightly. We first test our algorithm on simulated data and are able to fully recover the parameters used to generate the data and accurately recapitulate the sequence of hidden states. We then apply our algorithm to a recently published data set in which the observed neuronal ensembles displayed multistate behavior and show that inclusion of spike history information significantly improves the fit of the model. Additionally, we show that a simple reformulation of the state space of the underlying Markov chain allows us to implement a hybrid half-multistate, half-histogram model that may be more appropriate for capturing the complexity of certain data sets than either a simple HMM or a simple peristimulus time histogram model alone.},

By collecting data with mobile sensor nodes from individuals in a user community, e.g. using their smartphones, we can learn global information such as traac congestion paaerns in the city, location of key community facilities, and locations of gathering places. Can we publish and run queries on mobile sensor network databases without disclosing information about individual nodes? Diierential privacy is a strong notion of privacy which guaran-tees that very liile will be learned about individual records in the database, no maaer what the aaackers already know or wish to learn. Still, there is no practical system applying diierential pri-vacy algorithms for clustering points on real databases. .is paper describes the construction of small coresets for computing k-means clustering of a set of points while preserving diierential privacy. As a result, we give the erst k-means clustering algorithm that is both diierentially private, and has an approximation error that depends sub-linearly on the data's dimension d. Previous results introduced errors that are exponential in d. We implemented this algorithm and used it to create diierentially private location data from GPS tracks. Speciically our algorithm al-lows clustering GPS databases generated from mobile nodes, while leeing the user control the introduced noise due to privacy. We provide experimental results for the system and algorithms, and compare them to existing techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the erst practical system that enables diierentially private clustering on real data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Supervised learning methods need annotated data in order to generate efficient models. Annotated data, however, is a relatively scarce resource and can be expensive to obtain. For both passive and active learning methods, there is a need to estimate the size of the annotated sample required to reach a performance target. METHODS: We designed and implemented a method that fits an inverse power law model to points of a given learning curve created using a small annotated training set. Fitting is carried out using nonlinear weighted least squares optimization. The fitted model is then used to predict the classifier's performance and confidence interval for larger sample sizes. For evaluation, the nonlinear weighted curve fitting method was applied to a set of learning curves generated using clinical text and waveform classification tasks with active and passive sampling methods, and predictions were validated using standard goodness of fit measures. As control we used an un-weighted fitting method. RESULTS: A total of 568 models were fitted and the model predictions were compared with the observed performances. Depending on the data set and sampling method, it took between 80 to 560 annotated samples to achieve mean average and root mean squared error below 0.01. Results also show that our weighted fitting method outperformed the baseline un-weighted method (p \textbackslash textless 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This paper describes a simple and effective sample size prediction algorithm that conducts weighted fitting of learning curves. The algorithm outperformed an un-weighted algorithm described in previous literature. It can help researchers determine annotation sample size for supervised machine learning.},

  abstract = {Many complex dynamical phenomena can be effectively modeled by a system that switches among a set of conditionally linear dynamical modes. We consider two such models: the switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) and the switching vector autoregressive (VAR) process. Our Bayesian nonparametric approach utilizes a hierarchical Dirichlet process prior to learn an unknown number of persistent, smooth dynamical modes. We additionally employ automatic relevance determination to infer a sparse set of dynamic dependencies allowing us to learn SLDS with varying state dimension or switching VAR processes with varying autoregressive order. We develop a sampling algorithm that combines a truncated approximation to the Dirichlet process with efficient joint sampling of the mode and state sequences. The utility and flexibility of our model are demonstrated on synthetic data, sequences of dancing honey bees, the IBOVESPA stock index, and a maneuvering target tracking application.},

Different papers use different notions of algorithmic fairness, and although these appear internally consistent, they also seem mutually incompatible. We present a mathematical setting in which the distinctions in previous papers can be made formal. In addition to characterizing the spaces of inputs (the "observed" space) and outputs (the "decision" space), we introduce the notion of a construct space: a space that captures unobservable, but meaningful variables for the prediction. We show that in order to prove desirable properties of the entire decision-making process, different mechanisms for fairness require different assumptions about the nature of the mapping from construct space to decision space. The results in this paper imply that future treatments of algorithmic fairness should more explicitly state assumptions about the relationship between constructs and observations.},

  abstract = {This paper examines intrinsic brain networks in light of recent developments in the characterisation of resting state fMRI timeseries - and simulations of neuronal fluctuations based upon the connectome. Its particular focus is on patterns or modes of distributed activity that underlie functional connectivity. We first demonstrate that the eigenmodes of functional connectivity - or covariance among regions or nodes - are the same as the eigenmodes of the underlying effective connectivity, provided we limit ourselves to symmetrical connections. This symmetry constraint is motivated by appealing to proximity graphs based upon multidimensional scaling. Crucially, the principal modes of functional connectivity correspond to the dynamically unstable modes of effective connectivity that decay slowly and show long term memory. Technically, these modes have small negative Lyapunov exponents that approach zero from below. Interestingly, the superposition of modes - whose exponents are sampled from a power law distribution - produces classical 1/f (scale free) spectra. We conjecture that the emergence of dynamical instability - that underlies intrinsic brain networks - is inevitable in any system that is separated from external states by a Markov blanket. This conjecture appeals to a free energy formulation of nonequilibrium steady-state dynamics. The common theme that emerges from these theoretical considerations is that endogenous fluctuations are dominated by a small number of dynamically unstable modes. We use this as the basis of a dynamic causal model (DCM) of resting state fluctuations - as measured in terms of their complex cross spectra. In this model, effective connectivity is parameterised in terms of eigenmodes and their Lyapunov exponents - that can also be interpreted as locations in a multidimensional scaling space. Model inversion provides not only estimates of edges or connectivity but also the topography and dimensionality of the underlying scaling space. Here, we focus on conceptual issues with simulated fMRI data and provide an illustrative application using an empirical multi-region timeseries.},

  abstract = {Elicitation is the study of statistics or properties which are computable via empirical risk minimization. While several recent papers have approached the general question of which properties are elicitable, we suggest that this is the wrong question—all properties are elicitable by first eliciting the entire distribution or data set, and thus the important question is how elicitable. Specifically, what is the minimum number of regression parameters needed to compute the property? Building on previous work, we introduce a new notion of elicitation complexity and lay the foundations for a calculus of elicitation. We establish several general results and techniques for proving upper and lower bounds on elicitation complexity. These results provide tight bounds for eliciting the Bayes risk of any loss, a large class of properties which includes spectral risk measures and several new properties of interest. Finally, we extend our calculus to conditionally elicitable properties, which are elicitable conditioned on knowing the value of another property, giving a necessary condition for the elicitability of both properties together.},

  abstract = {Elicitation is a key task for subjectivist Bayesians. Although skeptics hold that elicitation cannot (or perhaps should not) be done, in practice it brings statisticians closer to their clients and subject-matter expert colleagues. This article reviews the state of the art, reflecting the experience of statisticians informed by the fruits of a long line of psychological research into how people represent uncertain information cognitively and how they respond to questions about that information. In a discussion of the elicitation process, the first issue to address is what it means for an elicitation to be successful; that is, what criteria should be used. Our answer is that a successful elicitation faithfully represents the opinion of the person being elicited. It is not necessarily "true" in some objectivistic sense, and cannot be judged in that way. We see that elicitation as simply part of the process of statistical modeling. Indeed, in a hierarchical model at which point the likelihood ends and the prior begins is ambiguous. Thus the same kinds of judgment that inform statistical modeling in general also inform elicitation of prior distributions. The psychological literature suggests that people are prone to certain heuristics and biases in how they respond to situations involving uncertainty. As a result, some of the ways of asking questions about uncertain quantities are preferable to others, and appear to be more reliable. However, data are lacking on exactly how well the various methods work, because it is unclear, other than by asking using an elicitation method, just what the person believes. Consequently, one is reduced to indirect means of assessing elicitation methods. The tool chest of methods is growing. Historically, the first methods involved choosing hyperparameters using conjugate prior families, at a time when these were the only families for which posterior distributions could be computed. Modern computational methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, have freed elicitation from this constraint. As a result, now both parametric and nonparametric methods are available for low-dimensional problems. High-dimensional problems are probably best thought of as lacking another hierarchical level, which has the effect of reducing the as-yet-unelicited parameter space. Special considerations apply to the elicitation of group opinions. Informal methods, such as Delphi, encourage the participants to discuss the issue in the hope of reaching consensus. Formal methods, such as weighted averages or logarithmic opinion pools, each have mathematical characteristics that are uncomfortable. Finally, there is the question of what a group opinion even means, because it is not necessarily the opinion of any participant.},

The goal of this proposal is to enable better communication between dataset creators and users, and help the AI community move toward greater transparency and accountability. By analogy, in computer hardware, it has become industry standard to accompany everything from the simplest components (e.g., resistors), to the most complex microprocessor chips, with datasheets detailing standard operating characteristics, test results, recommended usage, and other information. We outline some of the questions a datasheet for datasets should answer. These questions focus on when, where, and how the training data was gathered, its recommended use cases, and, in the case of human-centric datasets, information regarding the subjects' demographics and consent as applicable. We develop prototypes of datasheets for two well-known datasets: Labeled Faces in The Wild and the Pang \$\textbackslash backslash\$\& Lee Polarity Dataset.},

We first review what is known about multisensory processing in higher-order association cortices and then discuss recent anatomical and physiological findings in presumptive unimodal sensory areas. The pervasiveness of multisensory influences on all levels of cortical processing compels us to reconsider thinking about neural processing in unisensory terms. Indeed, the multisensory nature of most, possibly all, of the neocortex forces us to abandon the notion that the senses ever operate independently during real-world cognition.},

Classical partial dependence plots (PDPs) help visualize the average partial relationship between the predicted response and one or more features. In the presence of substantial interaction effects, the partial response relationship can be heterogeneous. Thus, an average curve, such as the PDP, can obfuscate the complexity of the modeled relationship. Accordingly, ICE plots refine the partial dependence plot by graphing the functional relationship between the predicted response and the feature for individual observations. Specifically, ICE plots highlight the variation in the fitted values across the range of a covariate, suggesting where and to what extent heterogeneities might exist. In addition to providing a plotting suite for exploratory analysis, we include a visual test for additive structure in the data generating model. Through simulated examples and real data sets, we demonstrate how ICE plots can shed light on estimated models in ways PDPs cannot. Procedures outlined are available in the R package ICEbox.},

  abstract = {The brain is the body's largest energy consumer, even in the absence of demanding tasks. Electrophysiologists report on-going neuronal firing during stimulation or task in regions beyond those of primary relationship to the perturbation. Although the biological origin of consciousness remains elusive, it is argued that it emerges from complex, continuous whole-brain neuronal collaboration. Despite converging evidence suggesting the whole brain is continuously working and adapting to anticipate and actuate in response to the environment, over the last 20 y, task-based functional MRI (fMRI) have emphasized a localizationist view of brain function, with fMRI showing only a handful of activated regions in response to task/stimulation. Here, we challenge that view with evidence that under optimal noise conditions, fMRI activations extend well beyond areas of primary relationship to the task; and blood-oxygen level-dependent signal changes correlated with task-timing appear in over 95\% of the brain for a simple visual stimulation plus attention control task. Moreover, we show that response shape varies substantially across regions, and that whole-brain parcellations based on those differences produce distributed clusters that are anatomically and functionally meaningful, symmetrical across hemispheres, and reproducible across subjects. These findings highlight the exquisite detail lying in fMRI signals beyond what is normally examined, and emphasize both the pervasiveness of false negatives, and how the sparseness of fMRI maps is not a result of localized brain function, but a consequence of high noise and overly strict predictive response models.},

  abstract = {Current neuroimaging software offer users an incredible opportunity to analyze their data in different ways, with different underlying assumptions. Several sophisticated software packages (e.g., AFNI, BrainVoyager, FSL, FreeSurfer, Nipy, R, SPM) are used to process and analyze large and often diverse (highly multi-dimensional) data. However, this heterogeneous collection of specialized applications creates several issues that hinder replicable, efficient, and optimal use of neuroimaging analysis approaches: (1) No uniform access to neuroimaging analysis software and usage information; (2) No framework for comparative algorithm development and dissemination; (3) Personnel turnover in laboratories often limits methodological continuity and training new personnel takes time; (4) Neuroimaging software packages do not address computational efficiency; and (5) Methods sections in journal articles are inadequate for reproducing results. To address these issues, we present Nipype (Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and Interfaces; http://nipy.org/nipype), an open-source, community-developed, software package, and scriptable library. Nipype solves the issues by providing Interfaces to existing neuroimaging software with uniform usage semantics and by facilitating interaction between these packages using Workflows. Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms, eases the design of Workflows within and between packages, allows rapid comparative development of algorithms and reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype supports both local and remote execution on multi-core machines and clusters, without additional scripting. Nipype is Berkeley Software Distribution licensed, allowing anyone unrestricted usage. An open, community-driven development philosophy allows the software to quickly adapt and address the varied needs of the evolving neuroimaging community, especially in the context of increasing demand for reproducible research.},

We then review recent applications of the Indian buffet process in machine learning, discuss its extensions, and summarize its connections to other stochastic processes.},

Similarly, feature selection for clustering tries to find one feature subset where one interesting clustering solution resides. However, a single data set may be multi-faceted and can be grouped and interpreted in many different ways, especially for high dimensional data, where feature selection is typically needed. Moreover, different clustering solutions are interesting for different purposes. Instead of committing to one clustering solution, in this paper we introduce a probabilistic nonparametric Bayesian model that can discover several possible clustering solutions and the feature subset views that generated each cluster partitioning simultaneously. We provide a variational inference approach to learn the features and clustering partitions in each view. Our model allows us not only to learn the multiple clusterings and views but also allows us to automatically learn the number of views and the number of clusters in each view.},

  abstract = {The particle filter (PF) was introduced in 1993 as a numerical approximation to the nonlinear Bayesian filtering problem, and there is today a rather mature theory as well as a number of successful applications described in literature. This tutorial serves two purposes: to survey the part of the theory that is most important for applications and to survey a number of illustrative positioning applications from which conclusions relevant for the theory can be drawn. The theory part first surveys the nonlinear filtering problem and then describes the general PF algorithm in relation to classical solutions based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the point mass filter (PMF). Tuning options, design alternatives, and user guidelines are described, and potential computational bottlenecks are identified and remedies suggested. Finally, the marginalized (or Rao-Blackwellized) PF is overviewed as a general framework for applying the PF to complex systems. The application part is more or less a stand-alone tutorial without equations that does not require any background knowledge in statistics or nonlinear filtering. It describes a number of related positioning applications where geographical information systems provide a nonlinear measurement and where it should be obvious that classical approaches based on Kalman filters (KFs) would have poor performance. All applications are based on real data and several of them come from real-time implementations. This part also provides complete code examples.}

Examples of that problem are found in the medical domain to predict the effect of a drug prior to administering it, or in econometrics to predict the effect of a new policy prior to issuing it. We concentrate on a given target variable to be predicted (e.g., health status of a patient) from a number of candidate predictive variables or "features" (e.g., risk factors in the medical domain). Under interventions, variable predictive power and causality are tied together. For instance, both smoking and coughing may be predictive of lung cancer (the target) in the absence of external intervention; however, prohibiting smoking (a possible cause) may prevent lung cancer, but administering a cough medicine to stop coughing (a possible consequence) would not. We propose four tasks from various application domains, each dataset including a training set drawn from a natural" distribution and three test sets: one from the same distribution as the training set and two corresponding to data drawn when an external agent is manipulating certain variables. The goal is to predict a binary target variable, whose values on test data are withheld. The participants were asked to provide predictions of the target variable on test data and the list of variables (features) used to make predictions. The challenge platform remains open for post-challenge submissions and the organization of other events is under way (see http://clopinet.com/causality).},

  abstract = {Algorithmic systems -- from rule-based bots to machine learning classifiers -- have a long history of supporting the essential work of content moderation and other curation work in peer production projects. From counter-vandalism to task routing, basic machine prediction has allowed open knowledge projects like Wikipedia to scale to the largest encyclopedia in the world, while maintaining quality and consistency. However, conversations about how quality control should work and what role algorithms should play have generally been led by the expert engineers who have the skills and resources to develop and modify these complex algorithmic systems. In this paper, we describe ORES: an algorithmic scoring service that supports real-time scoring of wiki edits using multiple independent classifiers trained on different datasets. ORES decouples several activities that have typically all been performed by engineers: choosing or curating training data, building models to serve predictions, auditing predictions, and developing interfaces or automated agents that act on those predictions. This meta-algorithmic system was designed to open up socio-technical conversations about algorithmic systems in Wikipedia to a broader set of participants. In this paper, we discuss the theoretical mechanisms of social change ORES enables and detail case studies in participatory machine learning around ORES from the 4 years since its deployment.},

  abstract = {Many real-life decision-making problems incorporate higher-order structure, involving interdependencies between different stimuli, actions, and subsequent rewards. It is not known whether brain regions implicated in decision making, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), use a stored model of the task structure to guide choice (model-based decision making) or merely learn action or state values without assuming higher-order structure as in standard reinforcement learning. To discriminate between these possibilities, we scanned human subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a simple decision-making task with higher-order structure, probabilistic reversal learning. We found that neural activity in a key decision-making region, the vmPFC, was more consistent with a computational model that exploits higher-order structure than with simple reinforcement learning. These results suggest that brain regions, such as the vmPFC, use an abstract model of task structure to guide behavioral choice, computations that may underlie the human capacity for complex social interactions and abstract strategizing.},

This paper discusses how non-expert users reuse workflows created by experts and representing complex data mining processes for text analytics. They include workflows for document classification, document clustering, and topic detection, all assembled from components available in well-known text analytics software libraries. The workflows expose to non-experts expert-level knowledge on how these individual components need to be combined with data preparation and feature selection steps to make the underlying statistical learning algorithms most effective. The framework allows non-experts to easily experiment with different combinations of data analysis processes, represented as workflows of computations that they can easily reconfigure. We report on our experiences to date on having users with limited data analytic knowledge and even basic programming skills to apply workflows to their data. © 2010 ACM.},

  abstract = {A Bayesian network is a graphical model that encodes probabilistic relationships among variables of interest. When used in conjunction with statistical techniques, the graphical model has several advantages for data analysis. One, because the model encodes dependencies among all variables, it readily handles situations where some data entries are missing. Two, a Bayesian network can be used to learn causal relationships, and hence can be used to gain understanding about a problem domain and to predict the consequences of intervention. Three, because the model has both a causal and probabilistic semantics, it is an ideal representation for combining prior knowledge (which often comes in causal form) and data. Four, Bayesian statistical methods in conjunction with Bayesian networks offer an efficient and principled approach for avoiding the overfitting of data. In this paper, we discuss methods for constructing Bayesian networks from prior knowledge and summarize Bayesian statistical methods for using data to improve these models. With regard to the latter task, we describe methods for learning both the parameters and structure of a Bayesian network, including techniques for learning with incomplete data. In addition, we relate Bayesian-network methods for learning to techniques for supervised and unsupervised learning. We illustrate the graphical-modeling approach using a real-world case study.},

We study a variation of this concept, in which the documents' mixture weight beliefs are replaced with squashed Gaussian distributions. This allows documents to be associated with elements of a Hilbert space, admitting kernel topic models (KTM), modelling temporal, spatial, hierarchical, social and other structure between documents. The main challenge is efficient approximate inference on the latent Gaussian. We present an approximate algorithm cast around a Laplace approximation in a transformed basis. The KTM can also be interpreted as a type of Gaussian process latent variable model, or as a topic model conditional on document features, uncovering links between earlier work in these areas.},

Our innovation in the GP model is to introduce a variation on the GP prior which enables us to model structured time-series data, i.e. data containing groups where we wish to model inter- and intra-group variability. Our innovation in the DP model is an implementation of a new fast collapsed variational inference procedure which enables us to optimize our variational approximation significantly faster than standard VB approaches. In a biological time series application we show how our model better captures salient features of the data, leading to better consistency with existing biological classifications, while the associated inference algorithm provides a significant speed-up over EM-based variational inference.},

As such, our work is the first-of-its-kind to model gravity at unprecedented fine scales yet with near-global coverage. The new picture of Earth's gravity encompasses a suite of gridded estimates of gravity accelerations, radial and horizontal field components, and quasi-geoid heights at over 3 billion points covering 80\% of Earth's land masses. We identify new candidate locations of extreme gravity signals, suggesting that the Committee on Data for Science and Technology standard for peak-to-peak variations in free-fall gravity is too low by about 40\%. The new models are beneficial for a wide range of scientific and engineering applications and freely available to the public.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) systems built on incomplete or biased data will often exhibit problematic outcomes. Current methods of data analysis, particularly before model development, are costly and not standardized. The Dataset Nutrition Label (the Label) is a diagnostic framework that lowers the barrier to standardized data analysis by providing a distilled yet comprehensive overview of dataset "ingredients" before AI model development. Building a Label that can be applied across domains and data types requires that the framework itself be flexible and adaptable; as such, the Label is comprised of diverse qualitative and quantitative modules generated through multiple statistical and probabilistic modelling backends, but displayed in a standardized format. To demonstrate and advance this concept, we generated and published an open source prototype with seven sample modules on the ProPublica Dollars for Docs dataset. The benefits of the Label are manyfold. For data specialists, the Label will drive more robust data analysis practices, provide an efficient way to select the best dataset for their purposes, and increase the overall quality of AI models as a result of more robust training datasets and the ability to check for issues at the time of model development. For those building and publishing datasets, the Label creates an expectation of explanation, which will drive better data collection practices. We also explore the limitations of the Label, including the challenges of generalizing across diverse datasets, and the risk of using "ground truth" data as a comparison dataset. We discuss ways to move forward given the limitations identified. Lastly, we lay out future directions for the Dataset Nutrition Label project, including research and public policy agendas to further advance consideration of the concept.},

  abstract = {Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are one of the most fundamental and widely used statistical tools for modeling discrete time series. In general, learning HMMs from data is computationally hard (under cryptographic assumptions), and practitioners typically resort to search heuristics which suffer from the usual local optima issues. We prove that under a natural separation condition (bounds on the smallest singular value of the HMM parameters), there is an efficient and provably correct algorithm for learning HMMs. The sample complexity of the algorithm does not explicitly depend on the number of distinct (discrete) observations—it implicitly depends on this quantity through spectral properties of the underlying HMM. This makes the algorithm particularly applicable to settings with a large number of observations, such as those in natural language processing where the space of observation is sometimes the words in a language. The algorithm is also simple, employing only a singular value decomposition and matrix multiplications.},

Here, we analyze recovery from pharmacologically induced coma to show that neuronal activity en route to consciousness is confined to a low-dimensional subspace. In this subspace, neuronal activity forms discrete metastable states persistent on the scale of minutes. The network of transitions that links these metastable states is structured such that some states form hubs that connect groups of otherwise disconnected states. Although many paths through the network are possible, to ultimately enter the activity state compatible with consciousness, the brain must first pass through these hubs in an orderly fashion. This organization of metastable states, along with dramatic dimensionality reduction, significantly simplifies the task of sampling the parameter space to recover the state consistent with wakefulness on a physiologically relevant timescale.},

Like several earlier models for fMRI analysis, Hidden Process Models assume that the observed data is generated by a sequence of underlying mental processes that may be triggered by stimuli. HPMs go beyond these earlier models by allowing for processes whose timing may be unknown, and that might not be directly tied to specific stimuli. HPMs provide a principled, probabilistic framework for simultaneously learning the contribution of each process to the observed data, as well as the timing and identities of each instantiated process. They also provide a framework for evaluating and selecting among competing models that assume different numbers and types of underlying mental processes. We describe the HPM framework and its learning and inference algorithms, and present experimental results demonstrating its use on simulated and real fMRI data. Our experiments compare several models of the data using cross-validated data log-likelihood in an fMRI study involving overlapping mental processes whose timings are not fully known. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In some cases, earlier definitions of fairness are similar or identical to definitions of fairness in current machine learning research, and foreshadow current formal work. In other cases, insights into what fairness means and how to measure it have largely gone overlooked. We compare past and current notions of fairness along several dimensions, including the fairness criteria, the focus of the criteria (e.g., a test, a model, or its use), the relationship of fairness to individuals, groups, and subgroups, and the mathematical method for measuring fairness (e.g., classification, regression).

Non-invasive measurements of brain activity with fMRI have greatly advanced our understanding of the large-scale functional organization supporting these fundamental features of brain function. Conclusions from previous resting-state fMRI investigations were based upon static descriptions of functional connectivity (FC), and only recently studies have begun to capitalize on the wealth of information contained within the temporal features of spontaneous BOLD FC. Emerging evidence suggests that dynamic FC metrics may index changes in macroscopic neural activity patterns underlying critical aspects of cognition and behavior, though limitations with regard to analysis and interpretation remain. Here, we review recent findings, methodological considerations, neural and behavioral correlates, and future directions in the emerging field of dynamic FC investigations. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

To search for such a space, we used fMRI to measure human brain activity evoked by natural movies. We then used voxelwise models to examine the cortical representation of 1,705 object and action categories. The first few dimensions of the underlying semantic space were recovered from the fit models by principal components analysis. Projection of the recovered semantic space onto cortical flat maps shows that semantic selectivity is organized into smooth gradients that cover much of visual and nonvisual cortex. Furthermore, both the recovered semantic space and the cortical organization of the space are shared across different individuals.},

Examples of random measures that have this characterization include the Dirichlet process, its two-parameter extension, the two-parameter Poisson–Dirichlet process, finite dimensional Dirichlet priors, and beta two-parameter processes. The rich nature of stick-breaking priors offers Bayesians a useful class of priors for nonparametric problems, while the similar construction used in each prior can be exploited to develop a general computational procedure for pltting them. In this article we present two general types of Gibbs samplers that can be used to fit posteriors of Bayesian hierarchical models based on stick-breaking priors. The first type of Gibbs sampler, referred to as a Pólya urn Gibbs sampler, is a generalized version of a widely used Gibbs sampling method currently employed for Dirichlet process computing. This method applies to stick-breaking priors with a known Pólya urn characterization, that is, priors with an explicit and simple prediction rule. Our second method, the blocked Gibbs sampler, is based on an entirely different approach that works by directly sampling values from the posterior of the random measure. The blocked Gibbs sampler can be viewed as a more general approach because it works without requiring an explicit prediction rule. We find that the blocked},

Conventional analysis methods focus on the spatial dimension of the data discarding the information about brain function contained in the temporal dimension. This paper presents a fully spatio-temporal multivariate analysis method using a state-space model (SSM) for brain function that yields not only spatial maps of activity but also its temporal structure along with spatially varying estimates of the hemodynamic response. Efficient algorithms for estimating the parameters along with quantitative validations are given. A novel low-dimensional feature-space for representing the data, based on a formal definition of functional similarity, is derived. Quantitative validation of the model and the estimation algorithms is provided with a simulation study. Using a real fMRI study for mental arithmetic, the ability of this neurophysiologically inspired model to represent the spatio-temporal information corresponding to mental processes is demonstrated. Moreover, by comparing the models across multiple subjects, natural patterns in mental processes organized according to different mental abilities are revealed.},

Multivariate classifiers, commonly used for brain state decoding, are restricted to simple experimental paradigms with a fixed number of alternatives and are limited in their representation of the temporal dimension of the task. Moreover, they learn a mapping from the data to experimental conditions and therefore do not explain the intrinsic patterns in the data. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach to building a spatio-temporal representation of mental processes using a state-space formalism, without reference to experimental conditions. Efficient Monte Carlo algorithms for estimating the parameters of the model along with a method for model-size selection are developed. The advantages of such a model in determining the mental-state of the subject over pattern classifiers are demonstrated using an fMRI study of mental arithmetic.},

  abstract = {The standard rules of probability can be interpreted as uniquely valid principles in logic. In this book, E. T. Jaynes dispels the imaginary distinction between 'probability theory' and 'statistical inference', leaving a logical unity and simplicity, which provides greater technical power and flexibility in applications. This book goes beyond the conventional mathematics of probability theory, viewing the subject in a wider context. New results are discussed, along with applications of probability theory to a wide variety of problems in physics, mathematics, economics, chemistry and biology. It contains many exercises and problems, and is suitable for use as a textbook on graduate level courses involving data analysis. The material is aimed at readers who are already familiar with applied mathematics at an advanced undergraduate level or higher. The book will be of interest to scientists working in any area where inference from incomplete information is necessary.},

  abstract = {Task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging (TF-fMRI) has great potential for advancing the understanding and treatment of neurologic illness. However, as with all measures of neural activity, variability is a hallmark of intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) identified by TF-fMRI. This variability has hampered efforts to define a robust metric of connectivity suitable as a biomarker for neurologic illness. We hypothesized that some of this variability rather than representing noise in the measurement process, is related to a fundamental feature of connectivity within ICNs, which is their non-stationary nature. To test this hypothesis, we used a large (n = 892) population-based sample of older subjects to construct a well characterized atlas of 68 functional regions, which were categorized based on independent component analysis network of origin, anatomical locations, and a functional meta-analysis. These regions were then used to construct dynamic graphical representations of brain connectivity within a sliding time window for each subject. This allowed us to demonstrate the non-stationary nature of the brain's modular organization and assign each region to a "meta-modular" group. Using this grouping, we then compared dwell time in strong sub-network configurations of the default mode network (DMN) between 28 subjects with Alzheimer's dementia and 56 cognitively normal elderly subjects matched 1:2 on age, gender, and education. We found that differences in connectivity we and others have previously observed in Alzheimer's disease can be explained by differences in dwell time in DMN sub-network configurations, rather than steady state connectivity magnitude. DMN dwell time in specific modular configurations may also underlie the TF-fMRI findings that have been described in mild cognitive impairment and cognitively normal subjects who are at risk for Alzheimer's dementia.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with further advances of the author's recent work on optimal design of control systems and Wiener filters. Specifically, we consider the problem of designing a system to control a plant when (1) not all state variables are measurable, (2) the measured state variables are contaminated with noise, and (3) there are random disturbances. An explicit design procedure (well adapted to digital computation) is presented. In addition, some fundamental new concepts (controllability, observability, etc.) are introduced. A general theory of control systems is outlined which answers many basic questions (what is controllable? why? how?) and gives a highly efficient method of computation. This paper is to be published in the Proceedings of the First IFAC Moscow Congress by Butterworth Scientific Publications in 1960.}

Students are drawn from one of two populations, which might have different type distributions. We assume that the employer at the end of the pipeline is rational, in the sense that it computes a posterior distribution on student type conditional on all information that it has available (college admissions, grades, and group membership), and makes a decision based on posterior expectation. We then study what kinds of fairness goals can be achieved by the college by setting its admissions rule and grading policy. For example, the college might have the goal of guaranteeing equal opportunity across populations: that the probability of passing through the pipeline and being hired by the employer should be independent of group membership, conditioned on type. Alternately, the college might have the goal of incentivizing the employer to have a group blind hiring rule. We show that both goals can be achieved when the college does not report grades. On the other hand, we show that under reasonable conditions, these goals are impossible to achieve even in isolation when the college uses an (even minimally) informative grading policy.},

  abstract = {Summary Studies in anesthetized animals have suggested that activity in early visual cortex is mainly driven by visual input and is well described by a feedforward processing hierarchy. However, evidence from experiments on awake animals has shown that both eye movements and behavioral state can strongly modulate responses of neurons in visual cortex; the functional significance of this modulation, however, remains elusive. Using visual-flow feedback manipulations during locomotion in a virtual reality environment, we found that responses in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex are strongly driven by locomotion and by mismatch between actual and expected visual feedback. These data suggest that processing in visual cortex may be based on predictive coding strategies that use motor-related and visual input to detect mismatches between predicted and actual visual feedback.}

  abstract = {It is now well-established that intrinsic variations in human neural and behavioral activity tend to exhibit scaling laws in their fluctuations and distributions. The meaning of these scaling laws is an ongoing matter of debate between isolable causes versus pervasive causes. A spiking neural network model is presented that self-tunes to critical branching and, in doing so, simulates observed scaling laws as pervasive to neural and behavioral activity. These scaling laws are related to neural and cognitive functions, in that critical branching is shown to yield spiking activity with maximal memory and encoding capacities when analyzed using reservoir computing techniques. The model is also shown to account for findings of pervasive 1/f scaling in speech and cued response behaviors that are difficult to explain by isolable causes. Issues and questions raised by the model and its results are discussed from the perspectives of physics, neuroscience, computer and information sciences, and psychological and cognitive sciences.},

When facing this pattern, psychologists often view it as anomalous. Here, we argue that Simpson's paradox is more common than conventionally thought, and typically results in incorrect interpretations-potentially with harmful consequences. We support this claim by reviewing results from cognitive neuroscience, behavior genetics, clinical psychology, personality psychology, educational psychology, intelligence research, and simulation studies. We show that Simpson's paradox is most likely to occur when inferences are drawn across different levels of explanation (e.g., from populations to subgroups, or subgroups to individuals). We propose a set of statistical markers indicative of the paradox, and offer psychometric solutions for dealing with the paradox when encountered-including a toolbox in R for detecting Simpson's paradox. We show that explicit modeling of situations in which the paradox might occur not only prevents incorrect interpretations of data, but also results in a deeper understanding of what data tell us about the world.},

BCM brings the intuitive power of CBR to a Bayesian generative framework. The BCM learns prototypes, the “quintessential” observations that best represent clusters in a dataset, by performing joint inference on cluster labels, prototypes and important features. Simultaneously, BCM pursues sparsity by learning subspaces, the sets of features that play important roles in the characterization of the prototypes. The prototype and subspace representation provides quantitative benefits in interpretability while preserving classification accuracy. Human subject experiments verify statistically significant improvements to participants' understanding when using explanations produced by BCM, compared to those given by prior art.},

  abstract = {Big Data has been variously defined in the literature. In the main, definitions suggest that Big Data possess a suite of key traits: volume, velocity and variety (the 3Vs), but also exhaustivity, resolution, indexicality, relationality, extensionality and scalability. However, these definitions lack ontological clarity, with the term acting as an amorphous, catch-all label for a wide selection of data. In this paper, we consider the question ‘what makes Big Data, Big Data?', applying Kitchin's taxonomy of seven Big Data traits to 26 datasets drawn from seven domains, each of which is considered in the literature to constitute Big Data. The results demonstrate that only a handful of datasets possess all seven traits, and some do not possess either volume and/or variety. Instead, there are multiple forms of Big Data. Our analysis reveals that the key definitional boundary markers are the traits of velocity and exhaustivity. We contend that Big Data as an analytical category needs to be unpacked, with the genus of Big Data further delineated and its various species identified. It is only through such ontological work that we will gain conceptual clarity about what constitutes Big Data, formulate how best to make sense of it, and identify how it might be best used to make sense of the world.},

Software is fundamentally composed of algorithms: sets of defined steps structured to process instructions/data to produce an output. This paper synthesises and extends emerging critical thinking about algorithms and considers how best to research them in practice. Four main arguments are developed. First, there is a pressing need to focus critical and empirical attention on algorithms and the work that they do given their increasing importance in shaping social and economic life. Second, algorithms can be conceived in a number of ways –technically, computationally, mathematically, politically, culturally, economically, contextually, materially, philosophically, ethically –but are best understood as being contingent, ontogenetic and performative in nature, and embedded in wider socio-technical assemblages. Third, there are three main challenges that hinder research about algorithms (gaining access to their formulation; they are heterogeneous and embedded in wider systems; their work unfolds contextually and contingently), which require practical and epistemological attention. Fourth, the constitution and work of algorithms can be empirically studied in a number of ways, each of which has strengths and weaknesses that need to be systematically evaluated. Six methodological approaches designed to produce insights into the nature and work of algorithms are critically appraised. It is contended that these methods are best used in combination in order to help overcome epistemological and practical challenges.},

  abstract = {There is still considerable doubt and even anxiety among simulation modelers as to what the methodologically correct guidelines or procedures for validating simulation models should be. Epistemically, the approaches one finds in the simulation literature run the gamut from objectivist to relativist with shades in between. At present in the philosophy of science, there appears to be a convergence toward a nonalgorithmic but discursive and nonrelativistic view of the argumentation involved in warranting scientific theorizing. The present paper attempts to give a description of the various philosophical positions as well as to summarize their problems and the kinds of evidentiary arguments they would each allow in arriving at defensible simulation models. From the debate, we attempt to set out a perspective that frees the practioner to pursue a varied set of approaches to validation with a diminished burden of methodological anxiety. Reciprocally this perspective does not let the modeler off of the hook but rather converts the validation problem into an ethical problem in which the practitioner must responsibly and professionally argue for the warrant of the model.

Such brain-based analyses are critical if our ways of labeling emotions are to be evaluated and revised based on consistency with brain data. Consistent activations were limited to specific cortical sub-regions, including multiple functional areas within medial, orbital, and inferior lateral frontal cortices. Consistent with a wealth of animal literature, multiple subcortical activations were identified, including amygdala, ventral striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus, and periaqueductal gray. We used multivariate parcellation and clustering techniques to identify groups of co-activated brain regions across studies. These analyses identified six distributed functional groups, including medial and lateral frontal groups, two posterior cortical groups, and paralimbic and core limbic/brainstem groups. These functional groups provide information on potential organization of brain regions into large-scale networks. Specific follow-up analyses focused on amygdala, periaqueductal gray (PAG), and hypothalamic (Hy) activations, and identified frontal cortical areas co-activated with these core limbic structures. While multiple areas of frontal cortex co-activated with amygdala sub-regions, a specific region of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC, Brodmann's Area 9/32) was the only area co-activated with both PAG and Hy. Subsequent mediation analyses were consistent with a pathway from dmPFC through PAG to Hy. These results suggest that medial frontal areas are more closely associated with core limbic activation than their lateral counterparts, and that dmPFC may play a particularly important role in the cognitive generation of emotional states.},

To address limitations of prior research using PCA, we studied effects of feature selection (sequential forward selection, sequential backward selection), classifier type (linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, neural networks, k-nearest neighbors method), and cross-validation method (subject- and stimulus-(in)dependence). Analyses were run on a data set of 34 participants watching two sets of three 10-min film clips (fearful, sad, neutral) while autonomic, respiratory, and facial muscle activity were assessed. Results demonstrate that the three states can be classified with high accuracy by most classifiers, with the sparsest model having only five features, even for the most difficult task of identifying the emotion of an unknown subject in an unknown situation (77.5\%). Implications for choosing PCA parameters are discussed.},

Positions on the degree of specificity of ANS activation in emotion, however, greatly diverge, ranging from undifferentiated arousal, over acknowledgment of strong response idiosyncrasies, to highly specific predictions of autonomic response patterns for certain emotions. A review of 134 publications that report experimental investigations of emotional effects on peripheral physiological responding in healthy individuals suggests considerable ANS response specificity in emotion when considering subtypes of distinct emotions. The importance of sound terminology of investigated affective states as well as of choice of physiological measures in assessing ANS reactivity is discussed.},

  abstract = {Humans spend much of their time engaged in stimulus-independent thoughts, colloquially known as "daydreaming" or "mind-wandering." A fundamental question concerns how awake, spontaneous brain activity represents the ongoing cognition of daydreaming versus unconscious processes characterized as "intrinsic." Since daydreaming involves brief cognitive events that spontaneously fluctuate, we tested the hypothesis that the dynamics of brain network functional connectivity (FC) are linked with daydreaming. We determined the general tendency to daydream in healthy adults based on a daydreaming frequency scale (DDF). Subjects then underwent both resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and fMRI during sensory stimulation with intermittent thought probes to determine the occurrences of mind-wandering events. Brain regions within the default mode network (DMN), purported to be involved in daydreaming, were assessed for 1) static FC across the entire fMRI scans, and 2) dynamic FC based on FC variability (FCV) across 30. s progressively sliding windows of 2. s increments within each scan. We found that during both resting and sensory stimulation states, individual differences in DDF were negatively correlated with static FC between the posterior cingulate cortex and a ventral DMN subsystem involved in future-oriented thought. Dynamic FC analysis revealed that DDF was positively correlated with FCV within the same DMN subsystem in the resting state but not during stimulation. However, dynamic but not static FC, in this subsystem, was positively correlated with an individual's degree of self-reported mind-wandering during sensory stimulation. These findings identify temporal aspects of spontaneous DMN activity that reflect conscious and unconscious processes. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The brain's commitment to the statistical and prosodic patterns that are experienced early in life might help to explain the long-standing puzzle of why infants are better language learners than adults.

  abstract = {Recent years have seen a boom in interest in machine learning systems that can provide a human-understandable rationale for their predictions or decisions. However, exactly what kinds of explanation are truly human-interpretable remains poorly understood. This work advances our understanding of what makes explanations interpretable under three specific tasks that users may perform with machine learning systems: simulation of the response, verification of a suggested response, and determining whether the correctness of a suggested response changes under a change to the inputs. Through carefully controlled human-subject experiments, we identify regularizers that can be used to optimize for the interpretability of machine learning systems. Our results show that the type of complexity matters: cognitive chunks (newly defined concepts) affect performance more than variable repetitions, and these trends are consistent across tasks and domains. This suggests that there may exist some common design principles for explanation systems.},

  abstract = {Hierarchical Bayesian modeling provides a flexible and interpretable way of extending simple models of cognitive processes. To introduce this special issue, we discuss four of the most important potential hierarchical Bayesian contributions. The first involves the development of more complete theories, including accounting for variation coming from sources like individual differences in cognition. The second involves the capability to account for observed behavior in terms of the combination of multiple different cognitive processes. The third involves using a few key psychological variables to explain behavior on a wide range of cognitive tasks. The fourth involves the conceptual unification and integration of disparate cognitive models. For all of these potential contributions, we outline an appropriate general hierarchical Bayesian modeling structure. We also highlight current models that already use the hierarchical Bayesian approach, as well as identifying research areas that could benefit from its adoption. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

However, little studied are the differences in approach and capabilities of existing fairness toolkits, and their fit-for-purpose in commercial contexts. Towards this, this paper identifies the gaps between the existing open source fairness toolkit capabilities and the industry practitioners’ needs. Specifically, we undertake a comparative assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of six prominent open source fairness toolkits, and investigate the current landscape and gaps in fairness toolkits through an exploratory focus group, a semi-structured interview, and an anonymous survey of data science/machine learning (ML) practitioners. We identify several gaps between the toolkits’ capabilities and practitioner needs, highlighting areas requiring attention and future directions towards tooling that better support ‘fairness in practice.’},

We investigate the problem of the stability of feature selection and study in detail the properties of two state-of-the-art feature selection method, i.e. support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) and random forest variable importance measures (RF-VIM) on the imbalanced intrusion detection data. Experimental results on KDD Cup 99 network intrusion data show the influence of imbalance rate on the stability of the algorithms, and demonstrate that stability is an important evaluation indicator of algorithm in practical applications of intrusion detection.},

Here we use a multivariate pattern analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data in humans to demonstrate that simple and isolated stimuli of one sense elicit distinguishable spatial patterns of neuronal responses, not only in their corresponding primary sensory cortex, but in other primary sensory cortices. These results indicate that primary sensory cortices, traditionally regarded as unisensory, contain unique signatures of other senses and, thereby, prompt a reconsideration of how sensory information is coded in the human brain.},

Current kernel-based approaches to this problem all share a set of common features: (i) they are supervised and hence require labeled training data; (ii) edges in the network are treated as mutually independent and hence topological properties are largely ignored; (iii) they lack a statistical interpretation. We argue that these common assumptions are often undesirable for network inference, and propose (i) an unsupervised kernel method (ii) that takes the global structure of the network into account and (iii) is statistically motivated. We show that our approach can explain commonly used heuristics in statistical terms. In experiments on social networks and unsupervised protein interaction prediction we compare different variants of our method which demonstrate appealing predictive performance.},

  abstract = {Collectively, machine learning (ML) researchers are engaged in the creation and dissemination of knowledge about data-driven algorithms. In a given paper, researchers might aspire to any subset of the following goals, among others: to theoretically characterize what is learnable, to obtain understanding through empirically rigorous experiments, or to build a working system that has high predictive accuracy. While determining which knowledge warrants inquiry may be subjective, once the topic is fixed, papers are most valuable to the community when they act in service of the reader, creating foundational knowledge and communicating as clearly as possible. Recent progress in machine learning comes despite frequent departures from these ideals. In this paper, we focus on the following four patterns that appear to us to be trending in ML scholarship: (i) failure to distinguish between explanation and speculation; (ii) failure to identify the sources of empirical gains, e.g., emphasizing unnecessary modifications to neural architectures when gains actually stem from hyper-parameter tuning; (iii) mathiness: the use of mathematics that obfuscates or impresses rather than clarifies, e.g., by confusing technical and non-technical concepts; and (iv) misuse of language, e.g., by choosing terms of art with colloquial connotations or by overloading established technical terms. While the causes behind these patterns are uncertain, possibilities include the rapid expansion of the community, the consequent thinness of the reviewer pool, and the often-misaligned incentives between scholarship and short-term measures of success (e.g., bibliometrics, attention, and entrepreneurial opportunity). While each pattern offers a corresponding remedy (don't do it), we also discuss some speculative suggestions for how the community might combat these trends.}

  abstract = {Most studies involving spontaneous fluctuations in the BOLD signal extract connectivity patterns that show relationships between brain areas that are maintained over the length of the scanning session. In this study, however, we examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of the BOLD fluctuations to identify common patterns of propagation within a scan. A novel pattern finding algorithm was developed for detecting repeated spatiotemporal patterns in BOLD fMRI data. The algorithm was applied to high temporal resolution T2*-weighted multislice images obtained from rats and humans in the absence of any task or stimulation. In rats, the primary pattern consisted of waves of high signal intensity, propagating in a lateral to medial direction across the cortex, replicating our previous findings (Majeed et al., 2009a). These waves were observed primarily in sensorimotor cortex, but also extended to visual and parietal association areas. A secondary pattern, confined to subcortical regions consisted of an initial increase and subsequent decrease in signal intensity in the caudate-putamen. In humans, the most common spatiotemporal pattern consisted of an alteration between activation of areas comprising the "default-mode" (e.g., posterior cingulate and anterior medial prefrontal cortices) and the "task-positive" (e.g., superior parietal and premotor cortices) networks. Signal propagation from focal starting points was also observed. The pattern finding algorithm was shown to be reasonably insensitive to the variation in user-defined parameters, and the results were consistent within and between subjects. This novel approach for probing the spontaneous network activity of the brain has implications for the interpretation of conventional functional connectivity studies, and may increase the amount of information that can be obtained from neuroimaging data.},

While many authors have sought to characterise aspects of this boundary work, there remains little research on how researchers, especially research higher degree students, might be adequately prepared to work sensitively in these cultural borderlands. This article draws upon the post-colonial concept of the ‘contact zone' to reconceptualise the knowledge and skills required by the successful intercultural researcher. It demonstrates how recognition of and engagement with cultural difference can create deconstructive, productive possibilities for innova- tive research and new knowledge. The article also examines the consequences of a lack of intercultural sensitivity and equity  the symbolic violence and exploitation present in the contemporary research arena. This recasting of research has significant implications for future research training.},

Consequently, homeostatic mechanisms are necessary to ensure stable neuronal and network function over an animal's lifetime. To understand how these homeostatic mechanisms might function, it is crucial to understand how tightly regulated synaptic and intrinsic properties must be for adequate network performance, and the extent to which compensatory mechanisms allow for multiple solutions to the production of similar behaviour. Here, we use examples from theoretical and experimental studies of invertebrates and vertebrates to explore several issues relevant to understanding the precision of tuning of synaptic and intrinsic currents for the operation of functional neuronal circuits.},

  abstract = {Dynamical causal modelling (DCM) for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique to infer directed connectivity among brain regions. These models distinguish between a neuronal level, which models neuronal interactions among regions, and an observation level, which models the hemodynamic responses each region. The original DCM formulation considered only one neuronal state per region. In this work, we adopt a more plausible and less constrained neuronal model, using two neuronal states (populations) per region. Critically, this gives us an explicit model of intrinsic (between-population) connectivity within a region. In addition, by using positivity constraints, the model conforms to the organization of real cortical hierarchies, whose extrinsic connections are excitatory (glutamatergic). By incorporating two populations within each region we can model selective changes in both extrinsic and intrinsic connectivity. Using synthetic data, we show that the two-state model is internal consistent and identifiable. We then apply the model to real data, explicitly modelling intrinsic connections. Using model comparison, we found that the two-state model is better than the single-state model. Furthermore, using the two-state model we find that it is possible to disambiguate between subtle changes in coupling; we were able to show that attentional gain, in the context of visual motion processing, is accounted for sufficiently by an increased sensitivity of excitatory populations of neurons in V5, to forward afferents from earlier visual areas.},

  abstract = {For cognitive neuroscience to go forward a more explicit effort is needed to use neurophysiology to constrain how the brain produces human mental functions. This review begins with the suggestion that two fundamental features may be critical for this effort. The first is the connectivity of the brain, which occupies an intermediate position between complete redundant interconnections and independence. The term semiconnected is presented as a designation, which is an obvious derivation of the term semiconductors as used in engineering. The second is transient response plasticity where a given neuron or collection of neurons may show rapid changes in response characteristics depending on experience. Response plasticity is a ubiquitous property of the brain rather than a unique characteristic of 'neurocognitive' regions. These two properties may be brought together when brain areas interact such that their aggregate function embodies cognition. Three examples are used to illustrate these general principles and to develop the idea that a particular region in isolation may not act as a reliable index for a particular cognitive function. Instead, the neural context in which an area is active may define the cognitive function. Neural context emphasizes that the particular spatiotemporal pattern of neural interactions may hold the key to bridge between brain and mind. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {The pattern of anatomical features of the brain revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is described in six patients incidentally identified as having acallosal brains. The complex of morphological features associated with complete agenesis of the corpus callosum included lateral displacement of slitlike anterior horns of the lateral ventricles (bullhorn-like shape), dilatation of the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles, absence of the septum pellucidum, lateral displacement of the cingulate gyri, complete separation of fornices and the presence of the anterior commissure and longitudinal callosal bundles (Probst's bundles). No compensatory enlargement of the anterior commissure was seen in the patients. The planimetrically measured cross-sectional areas of the anterior commissures were between 2.0 and 4.2 mm2 (mean 3.1) (in ten normal subjects they were 4.5, SD 0.4; range 3.8-5.2 mm2) and were reduced in four and normal in two patients. Inconstant morphological features were an absence of the posterior commissure and a radial pattern of the sulci and gyri on the medial aspect of the hemispheres. Conventional clinical testing revealed no abnormalities except a slight impairment of walking heel-to-toe in two patients. None of the patients had subjective restrictions of activities of daily life, which shows the efficacy of unknown compensatory processes.},

The approach is based on the use of a new information theo- retic selection criterion: the double input symmetrical relevance (DISR). The rationale of the criterion is that a set of variables can return an information on the output class that is higher than the sum of the infor- mations of each variable taken individually. This property will be made explicit by defining the measure of variable complementarity. A feature selection filter based on the DISR criterion is compared in theoretical and experimental terms to recently proposed information theoretic cri- teria. Experimental results on a set of eleven microarray classification tasks show that the proposed technique is competitive with existing fil- ter selection methods.},

  abstract = {Various measures can be used to estimate bias or unfairness in a predictor. Previous work has already established that some of these measures are incompatible with each other. Here we show that, when groups differ in prevalence of the predicted event, several intuitive, reasonable measures of fairness (probability of positive prediction given occurrence or non-occurrence; probability of occurrence given prediction or non-prediction; and ratio of predictions over occurrences for each group) are all mutually exclusive: if one of them is equal among groups, the other two must differ. The only exceptions are for perfect, or trivial (always-positive or always-negative) predictors. As a consequence, any non-perfect, non-trivial predictor must necessarily be "unfair" under two out of three reasonable sets of criteria. This result readily generalizes to a wide range of well-known statistical quantities (sensitivity, specificity, false positive rate, precision, etc.), all of which can be divided into three mutually exclusive groups. Importantly, The results applies to all predictors, whether algorithmic or human. We conclude with possible ways to handle this effect when assessing and designing prediction methods.},

We present a computational model that predicts the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neural activation associated with words for which fMRI data are not yet available. This model is trained with a combination of data from a trillion-word text corpus and observed fMRI data associated with viewing several dozen concrete nouns. Once trained, the model predicts fMRI activation for thousands of other concrete nouns in the text corpus, with highly significant accuracies over the 60 nouns for which we currently have fMRI data.},

The rapid growth of this new field has led to wildly inconsistent terminology and notation, presenting a serious challenge for cataloguing and comparing definitions. This paper attempts to bring much-needed order. First, we explicate the various choices and assumptions made—often implicitly—to justify the use of prediction-based decisions. Next, we show how such choices and assumptions can raise concerns about fairness and we present a notationally consistent catalogue of fairness definitions from the ML literature. In doing so, we offer a concise reference for thinking through the choices, assumptions, and fairness considerations of prediction-based decision systems.}

Using fMRI, we examined whether novel stimuli remain affectively salient across the lifespan, and therefore, whether novelty processing–a potentially survival-relevant function–is preserved with aging. Nineteen young and 22 older healthy adults were scanned during observing novel and familiar affective pictures while estimating their own subjectively experienced aroused levels. We investigated age-related difference of magnitude of activation, hemodynamic time course, and functional connectivity of BOLD responses in the amygdala. Although there were no age-related differences in the peak response of the amygdala to novelty, older individuals showed a narrower, sharper (i.e., "peakier") hemodynamic time course in response to novel stimuli, as well as decreased connectivity between the left amygdala and the affective areas including orbito-frontal regions. These findings have relevance for understanding age-related differences in memory and affect regulation.},

  abstract = {The study of fairness in intelligent decision systems has mostly ignored long-term influence on the underlying population. Yet fairness considerations (e.g. affirmative action) have often the implicit goal of achieving balance among groups within the population. The most basic notion of balance is eventual equality between the qualifications of the groups. How can we incorporate influence dynamics in decision making? How well do dynamics-oblivious fairness policies fare in terms of reaching equality? In this paper, we propose a simple yet revealing model that encompasses (1) a selection process where an institution chooses from multiple groups according to their qualifications so as to maximize an institutional utility and (2) dynamics that govern the evolution of the groups' qualifications according to the imposed policies. We focus on demographic parity as the formalism of affirmative action. We then give conditions under which an unconstrained policy reaches equality on its own. In this case, surprisingly, imposing demographic parity may break equality. When it doesn't, one would expect the additional constraint to reduce utility, however, we show that utility may in fact increase. In more realistic scenarios, unconstrained policies do not lead to equality. In such cases, we show that although imposing demographic parity may remedy it, there is a danger that groups settle at a worse set of qualifications. As a silver lining, we also identify when the constraint not only leads to equality, but also improves all groups. This gives quantifiable insight into both sides of the mismatch hypothesis. These cases and trade-offs are instrumental in determining when and how imposing demographic parity can be beneficial in selection processes, both for the institution and for society on the long run.},

  abstract = {A number of studies have focused on the role of specific brain regions, such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex during trials on which participants make errors, whereas others have implicated a host of more widely distributed regions in the human brain. Previous work has proposed that there are multiple cognitive control networks, raising the question of whether error-related activity can be found in each of these networks. Thus, to examine error-related activity broadly, we conducted a meta-analysis consisting of 12 tasks that included both error and correct trials. These tasks varied by stimulus input (visual, auditory), response output (button press, speech), stimulus category (words, pictures), and task type (e.g., recognition memory, mental rotation). We identified 41 brain regions that showed a differential fMRI BOLD response to error and correct trials across a majority of tasks. These regions displayed three unique response profiles: (1) fast, (2) prolonged, and (3) a delayed response to errors, as well as a more canonical response to correct trials. These regions were found mostly in several control networks, each network predominantly displaying one response profile. The one exception to this "one network, one response profile" observation is the frontoparietal network, which showed prolonged response profiles (all in the right hemisphere), and fast profiles (all but one in the left hemisphere). We suggest that, in the place of a single localized error mechanism, these findings point to a large-scale set of error-related regions across multiple systems that likely subserve different functions.},

Most existing clustering algorithms, however, only find one clustering solution, and provide little guidance to data analysts who may not be satisfied with that single clustering and may wish to explore alternatives. We introduce a novel approach that provides several clustering solutions to the user for the purposes of exploratory data analysis. Our approach additionally captures the notion that alternative clusterings may reside in different subspaces (or views). We present an algorithm that simultaneously finds these subspaces and the corresponding clusterings. The algorithm is based on an optimization procedure that incorporates terms for cluster quality and novelty relative to previously discovered clustering solutions. We present a range of experiments that compare our approach to alternatives and explore the connections between simultaneous and iterative modes of discovery of multiple clusterings.},

In degenerate functional neuroanatomy, multiple degenerate neuronal systems might be present in a single brain where they are either co-activated or remain latent during task performance. In degeneracy over subjects, a particular function may be sustained by only one neuronal system within a subject, but by different systems over subjects. Degeneracy over subjects might have arisen from (ab)normal variation in neurodevelopmental trajectories or long-term plastic changes following structural lesions. We discuss how degenerate neuronal systems can be revealed using (1) intersubject variability, (2) multiple lesion studies and (3) an iterative approach integrating information from lesion and functional imaging studies.},

Without further assumption the reliability of a test is defined. Parallel measurements are then independently defined, and the concept of replication is explicated. The derived axioms of the classical test theory model are then stated in a refined form of Woodbury's stochastic process notation, and the basic results of this model are derived. The assumptions of experimental independence, homogeneity of error distribution, and conditional independence are related to the classical model and to each other. Finally, a brief sketch of some stronger models assuming the independence of error and true scores or the existence of higher-order moments of error distributions or those making specific distributional assumptions is given.}

  abstract = {Humans need communication. The desire to communicate remains one of the primary issues for people with locked-in syndrome (LIS). While many assistive and augmentative communication systems that use various physiological signals are available commercially, the need is not satisfactorily met. Brain interfaces, in particular, those that utilize event related potentials (ERP) in electroencephalography (EEG) to detect the intent of a person noninvasively, are emerging as a promising communication interface to meet this need where existing options are insufficient. Existing brain interfaces for typing use many repetitions of the visual stimuli in order to increase accuracy at the cost of speed. However, speed is also crucial and is an integral portion of peer-to-peer communication; a message that is not delivered timely often looses its importance. Consequently, we utilize rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) in conjunction with language models in order to assist letter selection during the brain-typing process with the final goal of developing a system that achieves high accuracy and speed simultaneously. This paper presents initial results from the RSVP Keyboard system that is under development. These initial results on healthy and locked-in subjects show that single-trial or few-trial accurate letter selection may be possible with the RSVP Keyboard paradigm.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We aim to increase the symbol rate of electroencephalography (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) typing systems by utilizing context information. APPROACH: Event related potentials (ERP) corresponding to a stimulus in EEG can be used to detect the intended target of a person for BCI. This paradigm is widely utilized to build letter-by-letter BCI typing systems. Nevertheless currently available BCI typing systems still require improvement due to low typing speeds. This is mainly due to the reliance on multiple repetitions before making a decision to achieve higher typing accuracy. Another possible approach to increase the speed of typing while not significantly reducing the accuracy of typing is to use additional context information. In this paper, we study the effect of using a language model (LM) as additional evidence for intent detection. Bayesian fusion of an n-gram symbol model with EEG features is proposed, and a specifically regularized discriminant analysis ERP discriminant is used to obtain EEG-based features. The target detection accuracies are rigorously evaluated for varying LM orders, as well as the number of ERP-inducing repetitions. MAIN RESULTS: The results demonstrate that the LMs contribute significantly to letter classification accuracy. For instance, we find that a single-trial ERP detection supported by a 4-gram LM may achieve the same performance as using 3-trial ERP classification for the non-initial letters of words. SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, the fusion of evidence from EEG and LMs yields a significant opportunity to increase the symbol rate of a BCI typing system.},

  abstract = {In general, the results of psychophysiologic research on PTSD support the presence of a variety of autonomic, sensory, and cognitive processing differences between individuals with and without the disorder. The findings are diverse and include heightened responsiveness to trauma reminders; exaggerated startle; increased conditionability and autonomic responsiveness to aversive, high-intensity stimuli; and elevated tonic or baseline physiologic activity. Increased sensitivity of the central nervous system is suggested by electrophysiologic evidence for a failure to habituate to redundant information, over-responsiveness to novel information, and reduced cortical responsiveness to overstimulation. Cognitive processing abnormalities are suggested by electrophysiologic evidence for a reduced ability to attend to task-relevant information and increased attention to task-irrelevant, trauma-related information in individuals with PTSD. Some findings, such as the heightened physiologic and P300 response amplitude responses to trauma-related stimuli and increased HR response to loud tones, have been highly replicable and appear to be as reliable as any biologic finding in the psychiatric literature. Other findings, such as increased eye-blink startle responses and tonic or baseline physiologic activity, have been less consistently replicated and have led investigators to explore how stressful or threatening experimental contexts might produce phasic alterations in the psychophysiology of individuals with PTSD. We hope that the broad range of psychophysiologic investigations and findings in PTSD will inspire others to consider possible applications of these methodologies to their own clinical and research endeavors.},

  abstract = {Given the knowledge of class probability densities, a priori probabilities, and relative risk levels, Bayes classifier provides the optimal minimum-risk decision rule. Specifically, focusing on the two-class (detection) scenario, under certain symmetry assumptions, matched filters provide optimal results for the detection problem. Noticing that the Bayes classifier is in fact a nonlinear projection of the feature vector to a single-dimensional statistic, in this paper, we develop a smooth nonlinear projection filter constrained to the estimated span of class conditional distributions as does the Bayes classifier. The nonlinear projection filter is designed in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space leading to an analytical solution both for the filter and the optimal threshold. The proposed approach is tested on typical detection problems, such as neural spike detection or automatic target detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Results are compared with linear and kernel discriminant analysis, as well as classification algorithms such as support vector machine, AdaBoost and LogitBoost.},

  abstract = {We present fast methods for filtering voltage measurements and performing optimal inference of the location and strength of synaptic connections in large dendritic trees. Given noisy, subsampled voltage observations we develop fast l1-penalized regression methods for Kalman state-space models of the neuron voltage dynamics. The value of the l1-penalty parameter is chosen using cross-validation or, for low signal-to-noise ratio, a Mallows' Cp-like criterion. Using low-rank approximations, we reduce the inference runtime from cubic to linear in the number of dendritic compartments. We also present an alternative, fully Bayesian approach to the inference problem using a spike-and-slab prior. We illustrate our results with simulations on toy and real neuronal geometries. We consider observation schemes that either scan the dendritic geometry uniformly or measure linear combinations of voltages across several locations with random coefficients. For the latter, we show how to choose the coefficients to offset the correlation between successive measurements imposed by the neuron dynamics. This results in a "compressed sensing" observation scheme, with an important reduction in the number of measurements required to infer the synaptic weights.},

However, common methods for performing inference in state-space models with non-Gaussian observations rely on certain approximations which are not always accurate. Here we review direct optimization methods that avoid these approximations, but that nonetheless retain the computational efficiency of the approximate methods. We discuss a variety of examples, applying these direct optimization techniques to problems in spike train smoothing, stimulus decoding, parameter estimation, and inference of synaptic properties. Along the way, we point out connections to some related standard statistical methods, including spline smoothing and isotonic regression. Finally, we note that the computational methods reviewed here do not in fact depend on the state-space setting at all; instead, the key property we are exploiting involves the bandedness of certain matrices. We close by discussing some applications of this more general point of view, including Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for neural decoding and efficient estimation of spatially-varying firing rates.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: We propose a patient-specific algorithm for seizure prediction using multiple features of spectral power from electroencephalogram (EEG) and support vector machine (SVM) classification.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nMETHODS: The proposed patient-specific algorithm consists of preprocessing, feature extraction, SVM classification, and postprocessing. Preprocessing removes artifacts of intracranial EEG recordings and they are further preprocessed in bipolar and/or time-differential methods. Features of spectral power of raw, or bipolar and/or time-differential intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings in nine bands are extracted from a sliding 20-s-long and half-overlapped window. Nine bands are selected based on standard EEG frequency bands, but the wide gamma bands are split into four. Cost-sensitive SVMs are used for classification of preictal and interictal samples, and double cross-validation is used to achieve in-sample optimization and out-of-sample testing. We postprocess SVM classification outputs using the Kalman Filter and it removes sporadic and isolated false alarms. The algorithm has been tested on iEEG of 18 patients of 20 available in the Freiburg EEG database who had three or more seizure events. To investigate the discriminability of the features between preictal and interictal, we use the Kernel Fisher Discriminant analysis.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nKEY FINDINGS: The proposed patient-specific algorithm for seizure prediction has achieved high sensitivity of 97.5\% with total 80 seizure events and a low false alarm rate of 0.27 per hour and total false prediction times of 13.0\% over a total of 433.2 interictal hours by bipolar preprocessing (92.5\% sensitivity, a false positive rate of 0.20 per hour, and false prediction times of 9.5\% by time-differential preprocessing). This high prediction rate demonstrates that seizures can be predicted by the patient-specific approach using linear features of spectral power and nonlinear classifiers. Bipolar and/or time-differential preprocessing significantly improves sensitivity and specificity. Spectral powers in high gamma bands are the most discriminating features between preictal and interictal.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nSIGNIFICANCE: High sensitivity and specificity are achieved by nonlinear classification of linear features of spectral power. Power changes in certain frequency bands already demonstrated their possibilities for seizure prediction indicators, but we have demonstrated that combining those spectral power features and classifying them in a multivariate approach led to much higher prediction rates. Employing only linear features is advantageous, especially when it comes to an implantable device, because they can be computed rapidly with low power consumption.},

To investigate whether the spontaneous human brain network maintains long-term stability throughout a day, we evaluated the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of results from an independent component analysis (ICA), seed correlation analysis, and graph-theoretical analysis of resting state functional MRI, acquired from 12 young adults at three-hour intervals over 24 consecutive hours. According to the ICC of the usage strength of the independent network component defined by the root mean square of the temporal weights of the network components, the default mode network centered at the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, the superior parietal, and secondary motor networks showed a high temporal stability throughout the day (ICC \textbackslash textgreater 0.5). However, high intra-individual dynamicity was observed in the default mode network, including the anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex or posterior-anterior cingulate cortex, the hippocampal network, and the parietal and temporal networks. Seed correlation analysis showed a highly stable (ICC \textbackslash textgreater 0.5) extent of functionally connected regions from the posterior cingulate cortex, but poor stability from the hippocampus throughout the day. Graph-theoretical analysis using local and global network efficiency suggested that local brain networks are temporally stable but that long-range integration behaves dynamically in the course of a day. These results imply that dynamic network properties are a nature of the resting state brain network, which remains to be further researched. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Recent applications of network theory and theoretical neuroscience to large-scale brain networks have started to dissolve this mystery. Network analyses suggest that hierarchical modular brain networks are particularly suited to facilitate local (segregated) neuronal operations and the global integration of segregated functions. Although functional networks are constrained by structural connections, context-sensitive integration during cognition tasks necessarily entails a divergence between structural and functional networks. This degenerate (many-to-one) function-structure mapping is crucial for understanding the nature of brain networks. The emergence of dynamic functional networks from static structural connections calls for a formal (computational) approach to neuronal information processing that may resolve this dialectic between structure and function.},

Major challenges in analyzing the multitude of data pertaining to the functioning of the organ systems over time are to extract meaningful clinical patterns and to provide predictions for the future course of diseases. With their explicit states and probabilistic state transitions, Markov models seem to fit this purpose well. In complex domains such as intensive care a choice is often made between a simple model that is estimated from the data, or a more complex model in which the parameters are provided by domain experts. Our primary aim is to combine these approaches and develop a set of complex Markov models based on clinical data. In this paper we describe the design choices underlying the models, which enable them to identify temporal patterns, predict outcomes, and test clinical hypotheses. Our models are characterized by the choice of the dynamic hierarchical Bayesian network structure and the use of logistic regression equations in estimating the transition probabilities. We demonstrate the induction, inference, evaluation, and use of these models in practice in a case-study of patients with severe sepsis admitted to four Dutch ICUs.},

Using a simple controlled block design and an alternating block design, I first show why "baseline" should not be modeled (model over-parameterization), and how this affects effect sizes. I also show that, depending on what is tested; over-parameterization does not necessarily impact upon statistical results. Next, using a simple periodic vs. random event related design, I show how the hemodynamic model (hemodynamic function only or using derivatives) can affects parameter estimates, as well as detail the role of orthogonalization. I then relate the above results to the computation of percentage signal change. Finally, I discuss how these issues affect group analyses and give some recommendations.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a decision support system (DSS) with inductive learning capability for model management. Simulation is used as the primary environment for modeling manufacturing systems and their processes. We propose an adaptive DSS framework for incorporating machine learning into the real time scheduling of a flexible manufacturing system and flexible flow system. The resulting DSS, referred to as pattern directed scheduling (PDS) system, has the unique characteristic of being an adaptive scheduler. While the bulk of previous research on dynamic machine scheduling deals with the relative effectiveness of a single scheduling rule, the approach presented in this study provides a mechanism for the state-dependent selection of one from among several rules. We address the PDS approach in the context of a model management system (MMS), with built-in simulation and inductive learning modules for heuristic acquisition and refinement. These modules complement each other in performing the decision support functions. Computational results show that such a pattern directed scheduling approach leads to superior system performance. It also provides a new framework for developing adaptive DSS. © 1993.},

"Scripts" describing each subject's combat experiences as well as other experiences were read to them in the laboratory, and they were instructed to imagine the events the scripts portrayed, while heart rate, skin conductance, and frontalis electromyogram were recorded. The PTSD subjects' physiologic responses to their combat scripts were markedly higher than the controls'. The combined physiologic variables identified PTSD subjects with a specificity of 100\% and a sensitivity of 61\%. The results demonstrate exaggerated physiologic arousal during recollection of traumatic experiences in PTSD.},

In deriving MASS Learning, we also introduce Conserved Differential Information (CDI), an information-theoretic quantity that — unlike standard mutual information — can be usefully applied to deterministically-dependent continuous random variables like the input and output of a deep network. In a series of experiments, we show that deep networks trained with MASS Learning achieve competitive performance on supervised learning, regularization, and uncertainty quantification benchmarks.}

  abstract = {Here, we demonstrate that subject motion produces substantial changes in the timecourses of resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) data despite compensatory spatial registration and regression of motion estimates from the data. These changes cause systematic but spurious correlation structures throughout the brain. Specifically, many long-distance correlations are decreased by subject motion, whereas many short-distance correlations are increased. These changes in rs-fcMRI correlations do not arise from, nor are they adequately countered by, some common functional connectivity processing steps. Two indices of data quality are proposed, and a simple method to reduce motion-related effects in rs-fcMRI analyses is demonstrated that should be flexibly implementable across a variety of software platforms. We demonstrate how application of this technique impacts our own data, modifying previous conclusions about brain development. These results suggest the need for greater care in dealing with subject motion, and the need to critically revisit previous rs-fcMRI work that may not have adequately controlled for effects of transient subject movements.},

Petrie (1966) and gives practical details on methods of implementation of the theory along with a description of selected applications of the theory to distinct problems in speech recognition. Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described},

  abstract = {Dynamic functional integration of distinct neural systems plays a pivotal role in emotional experience. We introduce a novel approach for studying emotion-related changes in the interactions within and between networks using fMRI. It is based on continuous computation of a network cohesion index (NCI), which is sensitive to both strength and variability of signal correlations between pre-defined regions. The regions encompass three clusters (namely limbic, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and cognitive), each previously was shown to be involved in emotional processing. Two sadness-inducing film excerpts were viewed passively, and comparisons between viewer's rated sadness, parasympathetic, and inter-NCI and intra-NCI were obtained. Limbic intra-NCI was associated with reported sadness in both movies. However, the correlation between the parasympathetic-index, the rated sadness and the limbic-NCI occurred in only one movie, possibly related to a "deactivated" pattern of sadness. In this film, rated sadness intensity also correlated with the mPFC intra-NCI, possibly reflecting temporal correspondence between sadness and sympathy. Further, only for this movie, we found an association between sadness rating and the mPFC-limbic inter-NCI time courses. To the contrary, in the other film in which sadness was reported to commingle with horror and anger, dramatic events coincided with disintegration of these networks. Together, this may point to a difference between the cinematic experiences with regard to inter-network dynamics related to emotional regulation. These findings demonstrate the advantage of a multi-layered dynamic analysis for elucidating the uniqueness of emotional experiences with regard to an unguided processing of continuous and complex stimulation.},

We try to keep theory to the absolute minimum needed, and we work through the details much more explicitly than you usually see even in “introductory” explanations. That means we've attempted to be ridiculously explicit in our exposition and notation. After providing the reasons and reasoning behind Gibbs sampling (and at least nodding our heads in the direction of theory), we work through two applications in detail. The first is the derivation of a Gibbs sampler for Naive Bayes models, which illustrates a simple case where the math works out very cleanly and it's possible to “integrate out” the model's continuous parameters to build a more efficient algorithm. The second application derives the Gibbs sampler for a model that is similar to Naive Bayes, but which adds an additional latent variable. Having gone through the two examples, we discuss some practical implementation issues. We conclude with some pointers to literature that we've found to be somewhat more friendly to uninitiated readers.},

At the same time, federal and local programs have sought to increase the participation of women and minorities in science, mathematics, and engineering. Research has focused on each of these trends independently, but very few studies have considered their interaction by asking how intellectual preferences for and professional consequences of interdisciplinary science might be influenced by gender, race, and/or ethnicity. Focused specifically on gender, this paper considers the expectation that women will be more drawn to interdisciplinary research, and explores the learning styles, work preferences, and career behaviors that might anticipate and/or explicate gender differences in interdisciplinary science. Principal mechanisms by which researchers engage in interdisciplinarity - cross-fertilization, team-collaboration, field-creation, and problem-orientation - are tested for evidence of gendering using preliminary empirical data from three studies. The results of this exploratory analysis offer clues about possible tendencies and raise questions about the potential costs and benefits for those who adopt them. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Single-neuron activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is tuned to mixtures of multiple task-related aspects. Such mixed selectivity is highly heterogeneous, seemingly disordered and therefore difficult to interpret. We analysed the neural activity recorded in monkeys during an object sequence memory task to identify a role of mixed selectivity in subserving the cognitive functions ascribed to the PFC. We show that mixed selectivity neurons encode distributed information about all task-relevant aspects. Each aspect can be decoded from the population of neurons even when single-cell selectivity to that aspect is eliminated. Moreover, mixed selectivity offers a significant computational advantage over specialized responses in terms of the repertoire of input-output functions implementable by readout neurons. This advantage originates from the highly diverse nonlinear selectivity to mixtures of task-relevant variables, a signature of high-dimensional neural representations. Crucially, this dimensionality is predictive of animal behaviour as it collapses in error trials. Our findings recommend a shift of focus for future studies from neurons that have easily interpretable response tuning to the widely observed, but rarely analysed, mixed selectivity neurons.},

In this paper, we are interested in applying latent feature modeling to Find the latent structure behind the psychiatric disorders that can help to examine and explain the relationships among them. To this end, we use the large amount of information collected in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) database and propose to model these data using a nonparametric latent model based on the Indian BuFiet Process (IBP). Due to the discrete nature of the data, we First need to adapt the observation model for discrete random variables. We propose a generative model in which the observations are drawn from a multinomial-logit distribution given the IBP matrix. The implementation of an eFicient Gibbs sampler is accomplished using the Laplace approximation, which allows integrating out the weighting factors of the multinomial-logit likelihood model. We also provide a variational inference algorithm for this model, which provides a complementary (and less expensive in terms of computational complexity) alternative to the Gibbs sampler allowing us to deal with a larger number of data. Finally, we use the model to analyze comorbidity among the psychiatric disorders diagnosed by experts from the NESARC database. © 2014 Francisco J. R.

The robustness of this account was evident in a large-scale replication involving 18,420 participants.

In particular, we consider the effects of variations in how information is visualized, how instructional support is provided, and how computer simulations are embedded within the lesson scenario. The reviewed literature provides robust evidence that computer simulations can enhance traditional instruction, especially as far as laboratory activities are concerned.

  abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-FMRI) holds the promise of revealing brain functional connectivity without requiring specific tasks targeting particular brain systems. RS-FMRI is being used to find differences between populations even when a specific candidate target for traditional inferences is lacking. However, the problem with RS-FMRI is a lacking definition of what constitutes noise and signal. RS-FMRI is easy to acquire but is not easy to analyze or draw inferences from. In this commentary we discuss a problem that is still treated lightly despite its significant impact on RS-FMRI inferences; global signal regression (GSReg), the practice of projecting out signal averaged over the entire brain, can change resting-state correlations in ways that dramatically alter correlation patterns and hence conclusions about brain functional connectedness. Although Murphy et al. in 2009 demonstrated that GSReg negatively biases correlations, the approach remains in wide use. We revisit this issue to argue the problem that GSReg is more than negative bias or the interpretability of negative correlations. Its usage can fundamentally alter interregional correlations within a group, or their differences between groups. We used an illustrative model to clearly convey our objections and derived equations formalizing our conclusions. We hope this creates a clear context in which counterarguments can be made. We conclude that GSReg should not be used when studying RS-FMRI because GSReg biases correlations differently in different regions depending on the underlying true interregional correlation structure. GSReg can alter local and long-range correlations, potentially spreading underlying group differences to regions that may never have had any. Conclusions also apply to substitutions of GSReg for denoising with decompositions of signals aggregated over the network's regions to the extent they cannot separate signals of interest from noise. We touch on the need for careful accounting of nuisance parameters when making group comparisons of correlation maps.},

  abstract = {Brain function in ‘‘resting” state has been extensively studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI). However, drawing valid inferences, particularly for group comparisons, is fraught with pitfalls. Differing levels of brain-wide correlations can confound group comparisons. Global signal regression (GSReg) attempts to reduce this confound and is commonly used, even though it differentially biases correlations over brain regions, potentially leading to false group differences. We propose to use average brain-wide correlations as a measure of global correlation (GCOR), and examine the circumstances under which it can be used to identify or correct for differences in global fluctuations. In the process,we show the bias induced by GSReg to be a function only of the data's covariance matrix, and use simulations to compare corrections with GCOR as covariate to GSReg under various scenarios.Wefind that unlike GSReg,GCOR is a conservative approach that can reduce global variations, while avoiding the introduction of false significant differences, as GSReg can. However, as with GSReg, one can- not escape the interaction effect between the grouping variable andGCOR covariate on effect size. WhileGCORis a complementary measure for resting state-FMRI applicable to legacy data, it is a lesser substitute for proper level- I denoising. We also assess the applicability of GCOR to empirical data with motion-based subject grouping and compare group differences to those using GSReg. We find that, while GCOR reduced correlation differences be- tween high and low movers, it is doubtful that motion was the sole driver behind the differences in the first place.},

In this work, we investigate the use of ensemble feature selection techniques, where multiple feature selection methods are combined to yield more robust results. We show that these techniques show great promise for high-dimensional domains with small sample sizes, and provide more robust feature subsets than a single feature selection technique. In addition, we also investigate the effect of ensemble feature selection techniques on classification performance, giving rise to a new model selection strategy.},

We respond by investigating what it is an analyst needs to know to determine whether the algorithm in a computer system is improper, unethical, or illegal in itself. We argue that an “algorithmic ethics” can analyze a particular published algorithm. We explain the importance of developing a practical algorithmic ethics that addresses virtues, consequences, and norms: We increasingly delegate authority to algorithms, and they are fast becoming obscure but important elements of social structure.},

  abstract = {Most real-world dynamic systems are composed of different components that often evolve at very different rates. In traditional temporal graphical models, such as dynamic Bayesian networks, time is modeled at a fixed granularity, generally selected based on the rate at which the fastest component evolves. Inference must then be performed at this fastest granularity, potentially at significant computational cost. Continuous Time Bayesian Networks (CTBNs) avoid time-slicing in the representation by modeling the system as evolving continuously over time. The expectation-propagation (EP) inference algorithm of Nodelman et al. (2005) can then vary the inference granularity over time, but the granularity is uniform across all parts of the system, and must be selected in advance. In this paper, we provide a new EP algorithm that utilizes a general cluster graph architecture where clusters contain distributions that can overlap in both space (set of variables) and time. This architecture allows different parts of the system to be modeled at very different time granularities, according to their current rate of evolution. We also provide an information-theoretic criterion for dynamically re-partitioning the clusters during inference to tune the level of approximation to the current rate of evolution. This avoids the need to hand-select the appropriate granularity, and allows the granularity to adapt as information is transmitted across the network. We present experiments demonstrating that this approach can result in significant computational savings.},

Our method focuses on understanding shared features in a set of time series that exhibit significant individual variability. Our method builds on the framework of latent Diricihlet allocation (LDA) and its extension to hierarchical Dirichlet processes, which allows us to characterize each series as switching between latent “topics”, where each topic is characterized as a distribution over “words” that specify the series dynamics. However, unlike standard applications of LDA, we discover the words as we learn the model. We apply this model to the task of tracking the physiological signals of premature infants; our model obtains clinically significant insights as well as useful features for supervised learning tasks.},

It is extremely important to bring together all the alternative frames of thinking—from the various communities of developers, researchers, business leaders, policymakers, and citizens—to properly start acknowledging AI. This article highlights the ‘fruitful collaboration’ that sociology and AI could develop in both social and technical terms. We discuss how biases and unfairness are among the major challenges to be addressed in such a sociotechnical perspective. First, as intelligent machines reveal their nature of ‘magnifying glasses’ in the automation of existing inequalities, we show how the AI technical community is calling for transparency and explainability, accountability and contestability. Not to be considered as panaceas, they all contribute to ensuring human control in novel practices that include requirement, design and development methodologies for a fairer AI. Second, we elaborate on the mounting attention for technological narratives as technology is recognized as a social practice within a specific institutional context. Not only do narratives reflect organizing visions for society, but they also are a tangible sign of the traditional lines of social, economic, and political inequalities. We conclude with a call for a diverse approach within the AI community and a richer knowledge about narratives as they help in better addressing future technical developments, public debate, and policy. AI practice is interdisciplinary by nature and it will benefit from a socio-technical perspective.},

These efforts are empowering community groups, allowing them to participate fully in planning and policy discussions that affect their neighborhoods. This paper explores the nature of the information providers, the services they provide to community organizations, and the challenges they face in doing so. Combining their experiences with our view of the coming technical and societal issues allows us to forecast what the future might look like. We conclude that community groups will become more self-sufficient, but will continue to need outside expertise. Since not all community groups now have access to such intermediaries, more research and development should be undertaken to support the movement.}

Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the "alphabet" used to describe those systems.},

The challenge of personalized medicine is to develop tools that can accurately predict the trajectory of an individual's disease, which can in turn enable clinicians to optimize treatments. We represent an individual's disease trajectory as a continuous-valued continuous-time function describing the severity of the disease over time. We propose a hierarchical latent variable model that individualizes predictions of disease trajectories. This model shares statistical strength across observations at different resolutions–the population, subpopulation and the individual level. We describe an algorithm for learning population and subpopulation parameters offline, and an online procedure for dynamically learning individual-specific parameters. Finally, we validate our model on the task of predicting the course of interstitial lung disease, a leading cause of death among patients with the autoimmune disease scleroderma. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art and demonstrate significant improvements in predictive accuracy.},

The brain rewards a better-than-predicted result with a pulse of dopamine, thereby encouraging the organism to learn effective regulatory behaviors. The brain, by prioritizing behaviors and dynamically adjusting the flows of energy and nutrients, reduces costly errors and exploits more opportunities. Despite significant costs of computation, allostasis pays off and can now be recognized as a core principle of organismal design.},

  abstract = {The objective in nonparametric regression is to infer a function m(x) on the basis of a finite collection of noisy pairs \{(Xi, m(Xi) + Ni)\}n i=1, where the noise components Ni satisfy certain lenient assumptions and the domain points Xi are selected at random. It is known a priori only that m is a member of a nonparametric class of functions (that is, a class of functions like C[ 0, 1] which, under customary topologies, does not admit a homeomorphic indexing by a subset of a Euclidean space). The main theoretical contribution of this study is to derive uniform convergence bounds and uniform consistency on bounded intervals for the Nadaraya-Watson kernel estimator and its derivatives. Also, we obtain the corresponding convergence results for the Priestly-Chao estimator in the case that the domain points are nonrandom. With these developments we are able to apply nonparametric regression methodology to the problem of identifying noisy time-varying linear systems.},

  abstract = {Dissociations between subjective and physiological responses to stress are of central interest in coping research. However, little is known about their stability across situations and time. Two experimental sessions - separated by 1 year - were conducted to examine cross-situational consistency and longterm-stability of HR-derived and SCL-derived dissociation scores. In year 1, a speech stressor, the cold pressor and a video stressor (viewing of the speech video) were applied. In year 2, mental arithmetics, anagrams and a torture video were presented. Thirty-five students participated and HR, SCL and negative affect were recorded. For each stressor, standardized changes in negative affect were subtracted from changes in autonomic reactivity (HR and SCL, respectively). Dissociation scores were relatively consistent across the stressors with HR-derived scores exceeding SCL-derived scores. Longterm-stability proved acceptable (r=.61, P\textbackslash textless.001 for HR-derived and r=.40, P\textbackslash textless.05 for SCL-derived scores). In sum, verbal-autonomic response dissociations show considerable cross-situational and temporal stability and thus might be considered as traits.},

In the final part, we present our results concerning the occurrence of the Simpson's Paradox in Quantum Mechanics with focus on the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator and the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation.

  abstract = {Exact timing is essential for functional MRI data analysis. Datasets are commonly measured using repeated 2D imaging methods, resulting in a temporal offset between slices. To compensate for this timing difference, slice-timing correction (i.e. temporal data interpolation) has been used as an fMRI pre-processing step for more than fifteen years. However, there has been an ongoing debate about the effectiveness and applicability of this method. This paper presents the first elaborated analysis of the impact of the slice-timing effect on simulated data for different fMRI paradigms and measurement parameters, taking into account data noise and smoothing effects. Here we show, depending on repetition time and paradigm design, slice-timing effects can significantly impair fMRI results and slice-timing correction methods can successfully compensate for these effects and therefore increase the robustness of the data analysis. In addition, our results from simulated data were supported by empirical in vivo datasets. Our findings suggest that slice-timing correction should be included in the fMRI pre-processing pipeline. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging has become a powerful tool for the study of functional networks in the brain. Even "at rest," the brain's different functional networks spontaneously fluctuate in their activity level; each network's spatial extent can therefore be mapped by finding temporal correlations between its different subregions. Current correlation-based approaches measure the average functional connectivity between regions, but this average is less meaningful for regions that are part of multiple networks; one ideally wants a network model that explicitly allows overlap, for example, allowing a region's activity pattern to reflect one network's activity some of the time, and another network's activity at other times. However, even those approaches that do allow overlap have often maximized mutual spatial independence, which may be suboptimal if distinct networks have significant overlap. In this work, we identify functionally distinct networks by virtue of their temporal independence, taking advantage of the additional temporal richness available via improvements in functional magnetic resonance imaging sampling rate. We identify multiple "temporal functional modes," including several that subdivide the default-mode network (and the regions anticorrelated with it) into several functionally distinct, spatially overlapping, networks, each with its own pattern of correlations and anticorrelations. These functionally distinct modes of spontaneous brain activity are, in general, quite different from resting-state networks previously reported, and may have greater biological interpretability.},

  abstract = {Machine learning algorithms frequently require careful tuning of model hyperparameters, regularization terms, and optimization parameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a "black art" that requires expert experience, unwritten rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. Much more appealing is the idea of developing automatic approaches which can optimize the performance of a given learning algorithm to the task at hand. In this work, we consider the automatic tuning problem within the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). The tractable posterior distribution induced by the GP leads to efficient use of the information gathered by previous experiments, enabling optimal choices about what parameters to try next. Here we show how the effects of the Gaussian process prior and the associated inference procedure can have a large impact on the success or failure of Bayesian optimization. We show that thoughtful choices can lead to results that exceed expert-level performance in tuning machine learning algorithms. We also describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization on a diverse set of contemporary algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

  abstract = {Models of effective connectivity characterize the influence that neuronal populations exert over each other. Additionally, some approaches, for example Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) and variants of Structural Equation Modelling, describe how effective connectivity is modulated by experimental manipulations. Mathematically, both are based on bilinear equations, where the bilinear term models the effect of experimental manipulations on neuronal interactions. The bilinear framework, however, precludes an important aspect of neuronal interactions that has been established with invasive electrophysiological recording studies; i.e., how the connection between two neuronal units is enabled or gated by activity in other units. These gating processes are critical for controlling the gain of neuronal populations and are mediated through interactions between synaptic inputs (e.g. by means of voltage-sensitive ion channels). They represent a key mechanism for various neurobiological processes, including top-down (e.g. attentional) modulation, learning and neuromodulation. This paper presents a nonlinear extension of DCM that models such processes (to second order) at the neuronal population level. In this way, the modulation of network interactions can be assigned to an explicit neuronal population. We present simulations and empirical results that demonstrate the validity and usefulness of this model. Analyses of synthetic data showed that nonlinear and bilinear mechanisms can be distinguished by our extended DCM. When applying the model to empirical fMRI data from a blocked attention to motion paradigm, we found that attention-induced increases in V5 responses could be best explained as a gating of the V1–\textbackslash textgreaterV5 connection by activity in posterior parietal cortex. Furthermore, we analysed fMRI data from an event-related binocular rivalry paradigm and found that interactions amongst percept-selective visual areas were modulated by activity in the middle frontal gyrus. In both practical examples, Bayesian model selection favoured the nonlinear models over corresponding bilinear ones.},

  abstract = {How is it that groups of neurons dispersed through the brain interact to generate complex behaviors? Three papers in this issue present brain-scale studies of neuronal activity and dynamics (see the Perspective by Huk and Hart). Allen et al. found that in thirsty mice, there is widespread neural activity related to stimuli that elicit licking and drinking. Individual neurons encoded task-specific responses, but every brain area contained neurons with different types of response. Optogenetic stimulation of thirst-sensing neurons in one area of the brain reinstated drinking and neuronal activity across the brain that previously signaled thirst. Gründemann et al. investigated the activity of mouse basal amygdala neurons in relation to behavior during different tasks. Two ensembles of neurons showed orthogonal activity during exploratory and nonexploratory behaviors, possibly reflecting different levels of anxiety experienced in these areas. Stringer et al. analyzed spontaneous neuronal firing, finding that neurons in the primary visual cortex encoded both visual information and motor activity related to facial movements. The variability of neuronal responses to visual stimuli in the primary visual area is mainly related to arousal and reflects the encoding of latent behavioral states. Science, this issue p. eaav3932, p. eaav8736, p. eaav7893; see also p. 236 Neurons in the primary visual cortex encode both visual information and motor activity. Neuronal populations in sensory cortex produce variable responses to sensory stimuli and exhibit intricate spontaneous activity even without external sensory input. Cortical variability and spontaneous activity have been variously proposed to represent random noise, recall of prior experience, or encoding of ongoing behavioral and cognitive variables. Recording more than 10,000 neurons in mouse visual cortex, we observed that spontaneous activity reliably encoded a high-dimensional latent state, which was partially related to the mouse’s ongoing behavior and was represented not just in visual cortex but also across the forebrain. Sensory inputs did not interrupt this ongoing signal but added onto it a representation of external stimuli in orthogonal dimensions. Thus, visual cortical population activity, despite its apparently noisy structure, reliably encodes an orthogonal fusion of sensory and multidimensional behavioral information.}

Here, we test the hypothesis that temporal integration, measured as long-term memory in the history of neural activity, is another important quality underlying conscious awareness. For this aim, we study the temporal memory of blood oxygen level-dependent signals across the human nonrapid eye movement sleep cycle. Results reveal that this property gradually decreases from wakefulness to deep nonrapid eye movement sleep and that such decreases affect areas identified with default mode and attention networks. Although blood oxygen level-dependent spontaneous fluctuations exhibit nontrivial spatial organization, even during deep sleep, they also display a decreased temporal complexity in specific brain regions. Conversely, this result suggests that long-range temporal dependence might be an attribute of the spontaneous conscious mentation performed during wakeful rest.},

We test the hypothesis that subjects exhibit unstable wakefulness, i.e., drift into sleep during typical resting-state experiments. Analyzing 1,147 resting-state functional magnetic resonance data sets, we revealed a reliable loss of wakefulness in a third of subjects within 3min and demonstrated the dynamic nature of the resting state, with fundamental changes in the associated functional neuroanatomy. Implications include the necessity of wakefulness monitoring and modeling, taking measures to maintain a state of wakefulness, acknowledging the possibility of sleep and exploring its consequences, and especially the critical assessment of possible false-positive or false-negative results. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The study of rapid changes in brain dynamics and functional connectivity (FC) is of increasing interest in neuroimaging. Brain states departing from normal waking consciousness are expected to be accompanied by alterations in the aforementioned dynamics. In particular, the psychedelic experience produced by psilocybin (a substance found in "magic mushrooms") is characterized by unconstrained cognition and profound alterations in the perception of time, space and selfhood. Considering the spontaneous and subjective manifestation of these effects, we hypothesize that neural correlates of the psychedelic experience can be found in the dynamics and variability of spontaneous brain activity fluctuations and connectivity, measurable with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Fifteen healthy subjects were scanned before, during and after intravenous infusion of psilocybin and an inert placebo. Blood-Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) temporal variability was assessed computing the variance and total spectral power, resulting in increased signal variability bilaterally in the hippocampi and anterior cingulate cortex. Changes in BOLD signal spectral behavior (including spectral scaling exponents) affected exclusively higher brain systems such as the default mode, executive control, and dorsal attention networks. A novel framework enabled us to track different connectivity states explored by the brain during rest. This approach revealed a wider repertoire of connectivity states post-psilocybin than during control conditions. Together, the present results provide a comprehensive account of the effects of psilocybin on dynamical behavior in the human brain at a macroscopic level and may have implications for our understanding of the unconstrained, hyper-associative quality of consciousness in the psychedelic state.

  abstract = {Chunking is the recoding of smaller units of information into larger, familiar units. Chunking is often assumed to help bypassing the limited capacity of working memory (WM). We investigate how chunks are used in WM tasks, addressing three questions: (a) Does chunking reduce the load on WM? Across four experiments chunking benefits were found not only for recall of the chunked but also of other not-chunked information concurrently held in WM, supporting the assumption that chunking reduces load. (b) Is the chunking benefit independent of chunk size? The chunking benefit was independent of chunk size only if the chunks were composed of unique elements, so that each chunk could be replaced by its first element (Experiment 1), but not when several chunks consisted of overlapping sets of elements, disabling this replacement strategy (Experiments 2 and 3). The chunk-size effect is not due to differences in rehearsal duration as it persisted when participants were required to perform articulatory suppression (Experiment 3). Hence, WM capacity is not limited to a fixed number of chunks regardless of their size. (c) Does the chunking benefit depend on the serial position of the chunk? Chunks in early list positions improved recall of other, not-chunked material, but chunks at the end of the list did not. We conclude that a chunk reduces the load on WM via retrieval of a compact chunk representation from long-term memory that replaces the representations of individual elements of the chunk. This frees up capacity for subsequently encoded material. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Utilization of formal and informal environments, with African American mentors in engineering provides a unique experience for participants to discover the field and explore the disciplines. The combination of mentors who share ethnic background, similar experiences, and the actual content of the program help to diminish the barrier between minority K-12 students and engineering.

This method allows us to variationally integrate out the input variables of the Gaussian process and compute a lower bound on the exact marginal likelihood of the nonlinear latent variable model. The maximization of the variational lower bound provides a Bayesian training procedure that is robust to overfitting and can automatically select the dimensionality of the nonlinear latent space. We demonstrate our method on real world datasets. The focus in this paper is on dimensionality reduction problems, but the methodology is more general. For example, our algorithm is immediately applicable for training Gaussian process models in the presence of missing or uncertain inputs.},

  abstract = {Neural ensembles oscillate across a broad range of frequencies and are transiently coupled or "bound" together when people attend to a stimulus, perceive, think, and act. This is a dynamic, self-assembling process, with parts of the brain engaging and disengaging in time. But how is it done? The theory of Coordination Dynamics proposes a mechanism called metastability, a subtle blend of integration and segregation. Tendencies for brain regions to express their individual autonomy and specialized functions (segregation, modularity) coexist with tendencies to couple and coordinate globally for multiple functions (integration). Although metastability has garnered increasing attention, it has yet to be demonstrated and treated within a fully spatiotemporal perspective. Here, we illustrate metastability in continuous neural and behavioral recordings, and we discuss theory and experiments at multiple scales, suggesting that metastable dynamics underlie the real-time coordination necessary for the brain's dynamic cognitive, behavioral, and social functions. How does the transient coupling of neural ensembles that supports cognitive function occur? Tognoli and Kelso consider a mechanism known as metastability, discussing theory and data at multiple scales that suggest that metastable dynamics underlies the coordination necessary for the brain's dynamic functions. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Degeneracy, the ability of elements that are structurally different to perform the same function, is a prominent property of many biological systems ranging from genes to neural networks to evolution itself. Because structurally different elements may produce different outputs in different contexts, degeneracy should be distinguished from redundancy, which occurs when the same function is performed by identical elements. However, because of ambiguities in the distinction between structure and function and because of the lack of a theoretical treatment, these two notions often are conflated. By using information theoretical concepts, we develop here functional measures of the degeneracy and redundancy of a system with respect to a set of outputs. These measures help to distinguish the concept of degeneracy from that of redundancy and make it operationally useful. Through computer simulations of neural systems differing in connectivity, we show that degeneracy is low both for systems in which each element affects the output independently and for redundant systems in which many elements can affect the output in a similar way but do not have independent effects. By contrast, degeneracy is high for systems in which many different elements can affect the output in a similar way and at the same time can have independent effects. We demonstrate that networks that have been selected for degeneracy have high values of complexity, a measure of the average mutual information between the subsets of a system. These measures promise to be useful in characterizing and understanding the functional robustness and adaptability of biological networks.},

Therefore, its own conceptual foundations, which often remain implicit and unknown, may be critically relevant. We defend the thesis that choosing between different metaphysical views on the 'mind-body problem' may have important implications for the conceptual foundations of psychosomatic medicine, and therefore potentially also for its methods, scientific status and relationship with the scientific disciplines it aims to integrate: biomedical sciences (including neuroscience), psychology and social sciences. To make this point, we introduce three key positions in the philosophical 'mind-body' debate (emergentism, reductionism, and supervenience physicalism) and investigate their consequences for the conceptual basis of the biopsychosocial model in general and its 'psycho-biological' part ('mental causation') in particular. Despite the clinical merits of the biopsychosocial model, we submit that it is conceptually underdeveloped or even flawed, which may hamper its use as a proper scientific model.},

There has been significant controversy regarding healthcare policy for those service members and military veterans who returned from OEF/OIF deployments with both mild TBI and PTSD. There is currently little empirical evidence available to address these controversies. This review uses a cognitive neuroscience framework to address the potential impact of mild TBI on the development, course, and clinical management of PTSD. The field would benefit from research efforts that take into consideration the potential differential impact of mild TBI with versus without persistent cognitive deficits, longitudinal work examining the trajectory of PTSD symptoms when index trauma events involve TBI, randomized clinical trials designed to examine the impact of mild TBI on response to existing PTSD treatment interventions, and development and examination of potential treatment augmentation strategies.},

  abstract = {The "mind-brain supervenience" conjecture suggests that all mental properties are derived from the physical properties of the brain. To address the question of whether the mind supervenes on the brain, we frame a supervenience hypothesis in rigorous statistical terms. Specifically, we propose a modified version of supervenience (called ϵ-supervenience) that is amenable to experimental investigation and statistical analysis. To illustrate this approach, we perform a thought experiment that illustrates how the probabilistic theory of pattern recognition can be used to make a one-sided determination of ϵ-supervenience. The physical property of the brain employed in this analysis is the graph describing brain connectivity (i.e., the brain-graph or connectome). ϵ-supervenience allows us to determine whether a particular mental property can be inferred from one's connectome to within any given positive misclassification rate, regardless of the relationship between the two. This may provide further motivation for cross-disciplinary research between neuroscientists and statisticians.},

Firstly, the clustering of the data set should reveal some structure of the underlying data rather than model artifacts due to the random sampling process. Secondly, the more sample points we have, the more reliable the clustering should be. We discuss which methods can and cannot be used to tackle those prob- lems. In particular we argue that generalization bounds as they are used in statistical learning theory of classification are unsuitable in a general clustering framework.We suggest that the main replacements of general- ization bounds should be convergence proofs and stability considerations. This paper should be considered as a roadmap paper which identifies im- portant questions and potentially fruitful directions for future research about statistical clustering. We do not attempt to present a complete statistical theory of clustering.},

This paper gives an introduction to spiking neural networks, some biological background, and will present two models of spiking neurons that employ pulse coding. Networks of spiking neurons are more powerful than their non-spiking predecessors as they can encode temporal information in their signals, but therefore do also need different and biologically more plausible rules for synaptic plasticity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Persistent pain is measured by means of self-report, the sole reliance on which hampers diagnosis and treatment. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) holds promise for identifying objective measures of pain, but brain measures that are sensitive and specific to physical pain have not yet been identified.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nMETHODS: In four studies involving a total of 114 participants, we developed an fMRI-based measure that predicts pain intensity at the level of the individual person. In study 1, we used machine-learning analyses to identify a pattern of fMRI activity across brain regions–a neurologic signature–that was associated with heat-induced pain. The pattern included the thalamus, the posterior and anterior insulae, the secondary somatosensory cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the periaqueductal gray matter, and other regions. In study 2, we tested the sensitivity and specificity of the signature to pain versus warmth in a new sample. In study 3, we assessed specificity relative to social pain, which activates many of the same brain regions as physical pain. In study 4, we assessed the responsiveness of the measure to the analgesic agent remifentanil.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nRESULTS: In study 1, the neurologic signature showed sensitivity and specificity of 94\% or more (95\% confidence interval [CI], 89 to 98) in discriminating painful heat from nonpainful warmth, pain anticipation, and pain recall. In study 2, the signature discriminated between painful heat and nonpainful warmth with 93\% sensitivity and specificity (95\% CI, 84 to 100). In study 3, it discriminated between physical pain and social pain with 85\% sensitivity (95\% CI, 76 to 94) and 73\% specificity (95\% CI, 61 to 84) and with 95\% sensitivity and specificity in a forced-choice test of which of two conditions was more painful. In study 4, the strength of the signature response was substantially reduced when remifentanil was administered.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: It is possible to use fMRI to assess pain elicited by noxious heat in healthy persons. Future studies are needed to assess whether the signature predicts clinical pain. (Funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and others.).},

  abstract = {One of the most challenging problems facing crime analysts is that of identifying crime series, which are sets of crimes committed by the same individual or group. Detecting crime series can be an important step in predictive policing, as knowledge of a pattern can be of paramount importance toward finding the offenders or stopping the pattern. Currently, crime analysts detect crime series manually; our goal is to assist them by providing automated tools for discovering crime series from within a database of crimes. Our approach relies on a key hypothesis that each crime series possesses at least one core of crimes that are very similar to each other, which can be used to characterize the modus operandi (M.O.) of the criminal. Based on this assumption, as long as we find all of the cores in the database, we have found a piece of each crime series. We propose a subspace clustering method, where the subspace is the M.O. of the series. The method has three steps: We first construct a similarity graph to link crimes that are generally similar, second we find cores of crime using an integer linear programming approach, and third we construct the rest of the crime series by merging cores to form the full crime series. To judge whether a set of crimes is indeed a core, we consider both pattern-general similarity, which can be learned from past crime series, and pattern-specific similarity, which is specific to the M.O. of the series and cannot be learned. Our method can be used for general pattern detection beyond crime series detection, as cores exist for patterns in many domains.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) currently is diagnosed via clinical interview in which subjective self reports of traumatic events and associated experiences are discussed with a mental health professional. The reliability and validity of diagnoses can be improved with the use of objective physiological measures. METHODS: In this study, physiological activity was recorded from 58 male veterans (PTSD Diagnosis n = 16; Trauma Exposed/No PTSD Diagnosis: n = 23; No Trauma/No PTSD Diagnosis: n = 19) with and without PTSD and combat trauma exposure in response to emotionally evocative non-idiographic virtual reality stimuli. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences among the Control, Trauma, and PTSD groups were present during the viewing of two virtual reality videos. Skin conductance and interbeat interval features were extracted for each of ten video events (five events of increasing severity per video). These features were submitted to three stepwise discriminant function analyses to assess classification accuracy for Control versus Trauma, Control versus PTSD, and Trauma versus PTSD pairings of participant groups. Leave-one-out cross-validation classification accuracy was between 71 and 94\%. CONCLUSIONS: These results are promising and suggest the utility of objective physiological measures in assisting with PTSD diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Many neuroscience studies have demonstrated that the human amygdala is a central element in the neural workspace that computes affective value. Emerging evidence suggests that novelty is an affective dimension that engages the amygdala independently of other affective properties. This current study is the first in which novelty, valence, and arousal were systematically examined for their relative contributions to amygdala activation during affective processing. Healthy young adults viewed International Affective Picture System (IAPS) images that varied along the dimensions of valence (positive, negative, neutral), arousal (high, mid, low), and novelty (novel, familiar). The results demonstrate that, in comparison to negative (vs. positive) and high (vs. low) arousal stimuli, the amygdala has higher peak responses and a selectively longer time course of activation to novel (vs. familiar) stimuli. In addition, novelty differentially engaged other affective brain areas including those involved in controlling and regulating amygdala responses (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex), as well as those transmitting sensory signals that the amygdala modulates (e.g., occipitotemporal visual cortex). Taken together with other findings, these results support the idea that an essential amygdala function is signaling stimulus importance or salience. The results also suggest that novelty is a critical stimulus dimension for amygdala engagement (in addition to valence and arousal). ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Graphical models, such as Bayesian networks and Markov networks, represent joint distributions over a set of variables by means of a graph. When the graph is singly connected, local propagation rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities. Recently a number of researchers have empirically demonstrated good performance of these same local propagation schemes on graphs with loops, but a theoretical understanding of this performance has yet to be achieved. For graphical models with a single loop, we derive an analytical relationship between the probabilities computed using local propagation and the correct marginals. Using this relationship we show a category of graphical models with loops for which local propagation gives rise to provably optimal maximum a posteriori assignments (although the computed marginals will be incorrect). We also show how nodes can use local information in the messages they receive in order to correct their computed marginals. We discuss how these results can be extended to graphical models with multiple loops and show simulation results suggesting that some properties of propagation on single-loop graphs may hold for a larger class of graphs. Specifically we discuss the implication of our results for understanding a class of recently proposed error-correcting codes known as turbo codes.},

The present work was designed to (a) determine the generalisability of such a decline by comparing adult English adult Salish, and English infant subjects on their perception of a new non-English (Salish) speech contrast, and (b) delineate the time course of the developmental decline in this ability. The results of these experiments replicate our original finding by showing that infants can discriminate nonnative speech contrasts without relevant experience, and that there is a decline in that ability during ontogeny. Furthermore, data from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies shows that this decline occurs within the first year of life, and that it is a function of specific language experience.},

A total of 3714 biallelic markers, spaced about every 3.5 kilobases, were identified by analyzing the patterns obtained when total genomic DNA from two different strains of yeast was hybridized to high-density oligonucleotide arrays. The markers were then used to simultaneously map a multidrug-resistance locus and four other loci with high resolution (11 to 64 kilobases).},

The . ABSTRACT Machine learning (ML) promises data - driven insights and solutions for people from all walks of life , but the skill of crafting these solutions is possessed by only a few . Emerging research addresses this issue by creating ML tools that are easy and accessible to people who are not formally trained in ML (" non - experts ") . This work investigated how non - experts build ML solutions for themselves in real life . Our interviews and surveys revealed unique potentials of non - expert ML , as well several pitfalls that non - experts are susceptible to . For example , many perceived percentage accuracy as a sole measure of performance , thus problematic models proceeded to deployment . These observations suggested that , while challenging , making ML easy and robust should both be important goals of designing novice - facing ML tools . To advance on this insight , we discuss design implications and created a sensitizing concept to demonstrate how designers might guide non - experts to easily build robust solutions .},

We examined this association within the context of a neuroimaging study, using functional MRI to examine neural responses to electrical pain-inducing stimuli in 15 healthy subjects (6 females; age range = 20-30??years). Pain-inducing stimuli were presented during different emotional contexts, which were induced via the continuous presentation (5??s) of sad, happy, or neutral pictures of faces. We found that subjective pain ratings were higher in the sad emotional context than in the happy and neutral contexts, and that pain-related activation in the ACC was more pronounced in the sad context relative to the happy and neutral contexts. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analyses demonstrated amygdala to ACC connections during the experience of pain in the sad context. These findings serve to highlight the neural mechanisms that may be relevant to understanding the broader relationship between somatic complaints and negative emotion. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, we point out the importance of stable feature selection for knowledge discovery from high-dimensional data, and identify two causes of instability of feature selection algorithms: selection of a minimum subset without redundant features and small sample size. We propose a general framework for stable feature selection which emphasizes both good generalization and stability of feature selection results. The framework identifies dense feature groups based on kernel density estimation and treats features in each dense group as a coherent entity for feature selection. An efficient algorithm DRAGS (Dense Relevant Attribute Group Selector) is developed under this framework. We also introduce a general measure for assessing the stability of feature selection algorithms. Our empirical study based on microarray data verifies that dense feature groups remain stable under random sample hold out, and the DRAGS algorithm is effective in identifying a set of feature groups which exhibit both high classification accuracy and stability.},

  abstract = {Algorithmic decision making systems are ubiquitous across a wide variety of online as well as offline services. These systems rely on complex learning methods and vast amounts of data to optimize the service functionality, satisfaction of the end user and profitability. However, there is a growing concern that these automated decisions can lead, even in the absence of intent, to a lack of fairness, i.e., their outcomes can disproportionately hurt (or, benefit) particular groups of people sharing one or more sensitive attributes (e.g., race, sex). In this paper, we introduce a flexible mechanism to design fair classifiers by leveraging a novel intuitive measure of decision boundary (un)fairness. We instantiate this mechanism with two well-known classifiers, logistic regression and support vector machines, and show on real-world data that our mechanism allows for a fine-grained control on the degree of fairness, often at a small cost in terms of accuracy.}

  abstract = {This paper describes a novel feature selection algorithm embedded into logistic regression. It specifically addresses high dimensional data with few observations, which are commonly found in the biomedical domain such as microarray data. The overall objective is to optimize the predictive performance of a classifier while favoring also sparse and stable models. Feature relevance is first estimated according to a simple t-test ranking. This initial feature relevance is treated as a feature sampling probability and a multivariate logistic regression is iteratively reestimated on subsets of randomly and non-uniformly sampled features. At each iteration, the feature sampling probability is adapted according to the predictive performance and the weights of the logistic regression. Globally,the proposed selection method can be seen as an ensemble of logistic regression models voting jointly for the final relevance of features. Practical experiments reported on several microarray datasets show that the proposed method offers a comparable or better stability and significantly better predictive performances than logistic regression regularized with Elastic Net. It also outperforms a selection based on Random Forests, another popular embedded feature selection from an ensemble of classifiers.},

  abstract = {An effective approach is proposed in this paper to remove ocular artifacts from the raw EEG recording. The proposed approach first conducts the blind source separation on the raw EEG recording by the stationary subspace analysis (SSA) algorithm. Unlike the classic blind source separation algorithms, SSA is explicitly tailored to the understanding of distribution changes, where both the mean and the covariance matrix are taken into account. In addition, neither independency nor uncorrelation is required among the sources by SSA. Thereby, it can concentrate artifacts in fewer components than the representative blind source separation methods. Next, the components that are determined to be related to the ocular artifacts are projected back to be subtracted from EEG signals, producing the clean EEG data eventually. The experimental results on both the artificially contaminated EEG data and real EEG data have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method, in particular for the cases where limited number of electrodes are used for the recording, as well as when the artifact contaminated signal is highly nonstationary and the underlying sources cannot be assumed to be independent or uncorrelated.},

In this paper, we show that the key to discrimination discovery and prevention is to find the meaningful partitions that can be used to provide quantitative evidences for the judgment of discrimination. With the support of the causal graph, we present a graphical condition for identifying a meaningful partition. Based on that, we develop a simple criterion for the claim of non-discrimination, and propose discrimination removal algorithms which accurately remove discrimination while retaining good data utility. Experiments using real datasets show the effectiveness of our approaches.},

A thorough assessment of the literature indicates that interactions among myriad susceptibility factors, including social support, early life stress, sex, age, peri- and post-traumatic dissociation, cognitive appraisal of trauma, neuroendocrine abnormalities and gene polymorphisms, in conjunction with the inconsistent expression of the disorder across studies, confounds attempts to characterize PTSD as a monolithic disorder. Overall, our assessment of the literature addresses the great challenge in developing a behavioral and biomarker-based diagnosis of PTSD.},

  abstract = {The use of big data research methods has grown tremendously over the past five years in both academia and industry. As the size and complexity of available datasets has grown, so too have the ethical questions raised by big data research. These questions become increasingly urgent as data and research agendas move well beyond those typical of the computational and natural sciences, to more directly address sensitive aspects of human behavior, interaction, and health. The tools of big data research are increasingly woven into our daily lives, including mining digital medical records for scientific and economic insights, mapping relationships via social media, capturing individuals' speech and action via sensors, tracking movement across space, shaping police and security policy via ªpredictive policing,º and much more.}

Research in AI and cognitive science further suggests that one can view science as a search through a space of theories that requires two active components \{a generator and a test. The generator produces new theories or variants on existing theories, whereas the test yields information concerning the quality of theories. Science incorporates a variety of tests that\vphantom\}}
