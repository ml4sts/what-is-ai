# What is AI *not*? 


## AI is not magic

> Biologogy is much more magical than anything in a computer. 

There is still a lot about biology that we do not know and biological systems are a part of the *natural* world, that we study through science formally and that we learn informally about through senses during our lived experiences.
AI is a part of a computer, it is *designed* so, at some level every bit of it is known, if not all well understood.  

## Generative AI is not automation

Machines can automate things, in general, we expect automated processes to be highly reliable. 
Generative AI is designed to *generate* text based on a pattern that starts with a prompt. 

Automation can save a lot of time, but inserting a generative model in the middle may insert randomness into processes that do not need any.  

## Generative AI is not deterministic 

It will not give the same response to a given prompt every time

## Generative AI is not good at math

Fundamentally, an LLM cannot do any actual calculations, unless it is an agent than can operate a tool (like a calculator). They sometimes provide and can be strategically prompted to give the right answer and special training procedures have shown progress in this. 


## Generative AI is not search

Traditional, strict search {term}`algorithms <algorithm>`
